Where do you Run Your Courses? Since Covid 19 the majority of our courses have been held online, however we are beginning to run in-person courses again and our aim is to run more in-person courses in 2022. Our range of courses are guided by experienced tutors, are very accessible and we have something for everyone. Our main face to face course location is Samye Ling in South West Scotland. We also run c ourses throughout Europe via our franchises. Can I Try Your Courses for Free? If you are looking for a Free Mindfulness Course then why not try our free daily mindfulness meditation . Every day during the week we provide free guided mindfulness meditations online.  These run at 10:30am and 7pm weekdays and at 7pm weekends. We also provide a Widening Access initiative providing free courses by making some places on each course available to people who would otherwise not be able to access this training. Please click here for further information. Are Your Mindfulness Courses Accredited? There is currently no Mindfulness Regulatory Body in the UK that accredits Mindfulness courses. However, our Mindfulness courses are recognised by the British Association of Mindfulness Based Approaches (BAMBA) in their UK Good Practice Guidelines. BAMBA is an inclusive community of mindfulness practitioners, teachers, trainers and researchers which upholds standards with inclusivity, integrity and humanity. As an organisation we are a member of BAMBA and our teacher training pathway leads to registration on the UK Listing of Mindfulness teachers, administered by BAMBA. We support our newly trained Mindfulness Teachers to register on the UK Listing and to comply with the BAMBA Good Practice Guidelines. All our Mindfulness Courses are taught by tutors who are registered with BAMBA and have decades of experience . Do I Get a Certificate of Completion? We provide a certificate of completion for our Accredited Mindfulness Level 1, Compassion Level 2, Insight Level 3 and Wisdom Level 4 courses. Ready to Teach certificates are also provided to successful participants who have undergone the Level 2 and Level 3 Teacher Training Courses. I want to Train to Become a Mindfulness Teacher. Can You Help? You have come to the right place. If you have engaged in mindfulness training yourself and feel you have benefited, then what a wonderful opportunity to help share the benefits of mindfulness practice with others so they benefit too. Please join our Mindfulness Teacher Training pathway and share the benefits of Mindfulness with others. Does it Matter if I Have Trained Elsewhere? Not at all, in fact, we welcome everyone who has trained in Mindfulness elsewhere. This might be MBSR, MBCT, Breathworks or another 8 week Mindfulness Based Course. We have a dedicated access course for people that have trained in other 8 week courses enabling them to skip Level 1 and join our Mindfulness Level 2 – Responding with Compassion Are Mindfulness Courses Worth It? A resounding Yes! Participants of our courses report that they have personally transformed the way they relate to themselves and their lives from having trained in Mindfulness and Compassion.  They tell us that they are able to cope with life’s challenges much better. The teacher training courses enable Mindfulness Practitioners to deepen into their practice as they learn how to share Mindfulness with others. Here are some testimonials from our participants where they share how they have benefited from Mindfulness. .carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div{width:36px;height:36px;border-radius:500px;}\n.dt-arrow-border-on.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div:not(:hover):before{border-width:0px;}\n.dt-arrow-hover-border-on.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div:hover:after{border-width:0px;}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div.owl-prev{top:50%;transform:translateY(calc(-50% + 0px));left:-5px;}\n@media all and (-ms-high-contrast: none) {\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div.owl-prev{transform:translateY(-50%);margin-top:0px;}\n}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div.owl-prev i{padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div.owl-next{top:50%;transform:translateY(calc(-50% + 0px));right:-5px;}\n@media all and (-ms-high-contrast: none) {\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div.owl-next{transform:translateY(-50%);margin-top:0px;}\n}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div.owl-next i{padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav i{font-size:18px;}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div:not(:hover) i,\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div:not(:hover) i:before{color:#ffffff;background:none;}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div:hover i, .carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.owl-carousel .owl-nav div:hover i:before{color:rgba(255,255,255,0.75);background:none;}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890 .owl-dots{top:calc(100% + 20px);left:50%;transform:translateX(calc(-50% + 0px));}\n@media all and (-ms-high-contrast: none) {\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890 .owl-dots{transform:translateX(-50%);margin-left:0px;}\n}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890 .owl-dot{width:10px;height:10px;margin:0 8px;}\n@media screen and (max-width:778px){\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.hide-arrows .owl-nav a{display:none;}\n}\n@media screen and (max-width:778px){\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.reposition-arrows .owl-nav .owl-prev{top:50%;transform:translateY(calc(-50% + 0px));left:10px;}\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.reposition-arrows .owl-nav .owl-next{top:50%;transform:translateY(calc(-50% + 0px));right:10px;}\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 778px) and all and (-ms-high-contrast: none) {\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.reposition-arrows .owl-nav .owl-prev{transform:translateY(-50%);margin-top:0px;}\n}\n@media screen and (max-width: 778px) and all and (-ms-high-contrast: none) {\n.carousel-shortcode.carousel-shortcode-id-89a7895c97f6a00028e568f9277c1890.reposition-arrows .owl-nav .owl-next{transform:translateY(-50%);margin-top:0px;}\n} “It is a great course for beginners and more experienced practitioners alike. Such a great atmosphere for openness and growth” “I really appreciated how secular and accessible this course was” “I would definitely recommend the course – it’s transformational. The teaching, guidance and practices felt very clear, safe and came from a place of kindness and integrity” “I’ve never devoted so much to being mindful and this deepened my self-understanding. I began to see through the layers of conditioning and personality which have caused me problems and held me back from peace. On Sunday evening I was literally looking for my previous problems and anxieties and couldn’t see them” “The group itself was beautiful, everyone was open, strong and vulnerable in their own ways and a I felt so comfortable among them” “I enjoyed meeting a new group of people with a shared interest and intention.” “It was an oasis in the midst of very challenging time…I am feeling much calmer and more able to distance myself from the stresses of daily life which I have no control over.” Do you Offer Free Mindfulness Courses for Charities, CIC and Other Causes? Yes. WE collaborate with and provide funding for the Everyone Project Charity. This Charity funds the work of mindfulness teachers working in partnership with Charities and Voluntary Organisations to deliver 8 week Mindfulness Based Living Courses.

They report that mindfulness benefits them in their lives and helps them to cope better with these additional challenges. Can you Tell Me About The Benefits and What Mindfulness is Good For?

Our Seeing Deeply Insight Level 3 course aims to enable participants to develop their mindfulness practice by developing insight into the mental processes that drive our thoughts, emotions and behaviour. This Seeing Deeply course builds on the Level 1 and Mindfulness Level 2 – Responding with Compassion trainings that preceded it. In the insight training we deepen our understanding of psychological mental processes by exploring the roots of our experience, and what drives us. It is ideal for those who have completed the Level 2 mindfulness training and who wish to continue to develop their mindfulness practice. It meets the annual continuing professional development (CPD) requirements of the UK Good Practice Guidelines (GPGs) for mindfulness teachers.

    "full_description": "Neurodivergent Mindfulness Neurodivergent Mindfulness with the Mindfulness Association The Mindfulness Association is hosting an online peer-led space for members who identify as neurodivergent or are exploring whether a neurodivergent profile is relevant to them. Neurodivergence is an umbrella term that refers to brains that process experiences differently, and covers conditions such as autism and ADHD.   As more is understood about these conditions, many adults are becoming curious about whether they fall within a neurodivergent profile. We want to create a safe informal space that is inclusive to people who might have a different experience of mindfulness and related practices due to neurodivergence. There is an ever-expanding online resource for mindfulness and neurodivergence which we can draw on to inform our exploration. In the group, we will strive to maintain a neurodivergent-affirmative and non-judgemental attitude to support a compassionate journey of exploration and sharing. The monthly Wednesday space will be held by Elanor Kortland. Elanor has experience of teaching mindfulness to neurodiverse individuals (including through The Everyone Project), and has a number of family members who are neurodiverse. She has undertaken specific neurodiversity-informed mindfulness training with Su Hutton and is a Trustee of a charity for young people with learning difficulties. She believes passionately in allowing people to be their authentic, unique selves, and is looking forward to providing a space where different aspects of mindfulness and compassion can be tailored to best facilitate this. Do please join us on our compassionate journey! We will meet online on the third Wednesday of the month at 7pm. The next dates are: Wednesday 21st January, Wednesday 18th February and Wednesday 18th March 2026 Please contact info@mindfulnessassociation.net to register your interest and to receive the Zoom meeting links.

Share the benefits of Mindfulness with others as you train to teach with this online course. Our Online Mindfulness Teacher Training Level 1 course aims to support participants to begin developing a safe and effective mindfulness teaching practice. This course provides participants with opportunities to lead guided practices and enquiry with fellow participants in a safe environment. Feedback is from self, fellow participants and tutors takes place over twelve evenings and aims to support participants to begin developing a safe and effective mindfulness teaching practice. The course emphasises the requirement for participants to be able to embody mindfulness and compassion while teaching mindfulness training courses. The key skill is learning to stay fully present as you lead guided practices and enquiry. This skill depends entirely upon a sustained and regular personal mindfulness practice. If you have engaged in mindfulness training yourself and feel you have benefited, then what a wonderful opportunity to help share the benefits of mindfulness practice with others so they benefit too. As part of your mindfulness training, you may have noticed a personal transformation in terms of managing your own stress levels and increased wellbeing. By training to teach the 8-week Mindfulness Based Living Course, we can help others to relieve their stress, manage pain and chronic illness, achieve their full potential and really flourish in their lives. By going through the teacher training and sharing the benefits of mindfulness with others our own practice and understanding of mindfulness grows. In turn our practice deepens, and we reap the benefit too.

It will include inquiry skills, additional skills in facilitation to unfold experience, considerations when working one-to-one, navigating the various roles and functions you will take on as a mindfulness supervisor, setting up a working agreement and giving feedback using the MBITAC document. Within mindfulness supervision, the session itself is imbued with mindfulness. There are short periods of practice interspersed with dialogue and the dialogue itself becomes an exercise in being present. This all happens in the context of embodied groundedness and compassion. For this reason our embodiment of mindfulness in relationship will also be a focus during the course. On completing this training you will be ready to set yourself up as a mindfulness supervisor providing that you meet the Supervisor Good Practice Guidelines . Please note that you will not become a Mindfulness Association listed supervisor by doing this course. The course will consist of 5 components as follows: 5 x 1 hour sessions online bi-weekly at 7pm.

A quiz on the various documents and policies you need to be aware of. Commitment to a 1 hour session per week of peer supervision in pairs (20 mins supervising, 10 mins feedback then swop) Commitment to journaling for learning around the peer sessions. To be ready for this training you need to have: Completed the MBLC retreat or equivalent ie. have a readiness to teach certificate Be experienced as a mindfulness practitioner, having been practicing for a minimum of 4 years and having deeply integrated mindfulness into your life, with a sense that it is a priority.

This course is a stand-alone CPD course for mindfulness/compassion teachers at all stages and was preciously called The Fundamentals of Inquiry . A certificate of completion will be given at the end of the course. This course counts as Continuing Professional Development (CPD). For more on the power of inquiry , check out Fay’s blog post on inquiry Would you like to become more confident and skilled at inquiry? Inquiry is the area of teaching that mindfulness teachers are most concerned about. Inquiry can sometimes feel tricky and uncomfortable! During this course, we’ll be establishing a toolkit for you to turn to during inquiry, especially for those occasional challenging moments. This course will enhance inquiry skills by: Clarifying our understanding of the process of inquiry Practising trust of the process and inner compass Inquiry asks a lot of us, but as we learn and practise, we’ll discover that we have what it takes. Our embodiment of presence is itself the facilitator of the wisdom, kindness and delicacy needed to navigate inquiry-based dialogue. We will cover topics and difficulties commonly experienced by teachers of mindfulness including: struggling with wanting to fix a participant moving too quickly to teaching points containing the inquiry and keeping it on track responding to emotional expression knowing when to deepen the enquiry and when to leave space awareness of ‘triggering’ and how it might manifest balancing an individual inquiry whilst taking care of the group as a whole. Throughout the course we will be working together as a group as well as working within smaller peer groups.  We will address the concerns raised around inquiry through a mix of inner exploration, contemplative and instructive teachings, discussion and shared experience. We will explore how we are with ‘trusting emergence’ and letting go of expertise in favour of meeting the moment with bare attention. We will reflect on how it is to compassionately witness another and find ways to stay at home, and grounded, within our body/heart. Most of all we will enjoy the wonder of being part of each other’s moments of insight, as we explore the power of inquiry together. This course will be composed of: 4 bi-weekly online meetings as a group facilitated by Fay Adams (75 minutes each) Short video contemplations (20-30 mins) on embodiment of the following as an enquirer: Deep Listening, Not Knowing, Appreciation of Essential Goodness, Authenticity, Compassionate Mess, Curiosity 4 peer meetings online in groups of three (1 hour each) A short reflective written piece to be submitted (1 page) Weekly reflection questions and journaling ‘…inquiry is a dynamic engagement that needs to be open and open-ended, minute to minute, instant to instant.’ A. H. Almaas Past participant comments: ‘Thank you for a wonderful course. The content and exercises were excellent…I do feel I’m much more confident in facilitating inquiry because of the course.’ Katherine Michaelis ‘I have found it really stimulating and enriching, of my practice, teaching and intellectually. Top CPD!’ Alison Gear ‘The structure of the course was fantastic – and the mix between all elements right down to the summary question at the end made it such a huge learning experience.

There will be teachings on the above topics and opportunities for sharing our experiences with each other through mindful enquiry. However, the focus of the retreat will be the practice of presence, including mindful QiGong movement, body awareness practices and daily life practices. The first weekend of this retreat will include the option of attending sessions from our spring membership weekend, led by other MA tutors. This retreat is suitable for those who are just starting their mindfulness training as well as those who have years of practice experience. It is suitable for mindfulness teachers and will meet the BAMBA retreat requirements including periods of silence. To meet the needs of mindfulness teachers, there will be some optional sessions during the retreat to support mindfulness teachers in developing their teaching practice, in particular enquiry skills. For more details about the MA Membership please click here. There will be additional sessions for Mindfulness Teachers The teacher inhabits the practice of mindfulness. This is particularly conveyed through the teacher’s body in terms of his/her physical and non-verbal expression. Embodiment of mindfulness involves the teacher sustaining connection and responsiveness to moment-by-moment arising (within self, within individuals and within the group) and bringing the core attitudinal foundations of mindfulness practice to all of this. These attitudes are non-judging, patience, beginner’s mind, trust, non-striving, acceptance, and letting go (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). In this weekend and retreat we will explore what the power of presence means. On this retreat we will be embarking on a journey to cultivate and deepen our embodied presence through teachings, practices and opportunities for sharing. Drawing on the Compassion, Insight and Wisdom courses, these will include practices for deepening our sense of  feeling rooted and grounded in the body; mindful movement practices for cultivating ease and flow; practices for cultivating compassionate presence;  and practices for tapping into the wisdom that naturally resides in the body. All of these contribute to the experience of embodied presence which gives rise to a wellspring of qualities that enriches every aspect of our lives. We will also be looking in more depth at the qualities of Embodiment explored in Domain 3 of the MBI-TAC : present moment focus, responsiveness, calmness and vitality and the natural presence of the teacher. We will look at the attitudinal qualities of embodiment in more depth, exploring how it is to be patient, accepting, trusting, not judging or striving. There will be opportunities to enhance and practice your inquiry skills too as well as share with your like-minded community of mindfulness teachers. This retreat will satisfy your retreat requirements for your BAMBA registration. + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Date Mar 06 - 11 2026 Time 7:00 pm - 3:00 pm Cost £250.00 Labels Retreats Location Online Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

    "full_description": "Online Vision Board Reflection Day Do you feel that you’re a bit off course? Would you like to feel more aligned with yourself and your vision for life in 2026? Does the idea of feeling inspired by a sense of possibility and potential for the coming year stir something within you? Would time to reflect, create and share in friendly company be just lovely? You’re invited to join Fay Adams on Saturday 3rd January 2026 (10.00am-15.00pm) to creatively connect with your inspirations, aspirations, longings and dreams for 2026 through making a vision board! You don’t need to think of yourself as creative or artistic to participate – this is a day to follow your heart, leave aside your self-critic and get into the joy of creative flow. When we give dedicated time to getting out of our heads and connecting with ourselves though following our creative impulse and our intuitive hunches, we are often thrilled and surprised by what emerges. Vision boards seem to have a magical influence on the future through the power of clarity and intention and through bringing alignment with what feels true to us. If we connect with our heart, we find our north star and then we’re more likely to stay on course. On the day we’ll combine mindfulness practice and reflection with a long period of silent creative immersion and then we’ll conclude by sharing with others. We’ll give a little bit of kind attention to our self-critic before we begin, so that we feel more free to follow our flow and then we’ll see what emerges! Before the day you’ll be guided to prepare by gathering materials and inspiring images, quotes or poems. All you need as a minimum is a (preferably) A2 sized piece of card, thick paper or board, glue, some magazines to cut out, some scissors and something to make marks with. Even part of a cardboard box would work! More info will be sent out to you in the weeks preceding the day. You don’t have to be good at art to participate – just allowing emergence of any creativity from within is all that is needed. Have a watch of this short video to see an example – my 2024 vision board (credit goes to the Needs Based Coaching Institute for this wonderful idea and for facilitating the workshop that produced this)[/vc_column_text] [/vc_column][/vc_row] + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Tags: practice day , Themed Courses Date Jan 03 2026 Expired!

Location – to be confirmed The Mindfulness for Life Summer Retreat is an annual retreat and part of the Themed Courses . It is open to people who have completed our mindfulness, compassion and insight trainings or as part of the University of Aberdeen’s MSc in Mindfulness Studies , run in partnership with the Mindfulness Association. The Mindfulness for Life retreats and gatherings provide participants with a space in which to come together and explore their practice in more depth and to continue the path of personal discovery in whatever form that may be for each participant. All participants speak a common language, which comes from a shared understanding of the variety of practices they have been introduced to over the course of the mindfulness, compassion, and insight modules with the Mindfulness Association. During our sessions together at the summer retreat, supported by Ian, Kristine and Vin, we may explore these practices in more depth or allow for more time and space to engage fully in the exercises that currently work for us. We will also explore new practices and different teaching methods and theories that may support our understanding further. In addition to the annual retreat, participants are also offered the opportunity to participate in two additional practice days. The Mindfulness for Life Spring and Autumn Gatherings are informal practice days where we connect with fellow practitioners. Previous participants from the said: I loved the variety of practises, how they were put together, in particular the different approaches to resting… And the emphasis on simplicity and what personally works was liberating… I value the connection with others too… I found this retreat incredibly beneficial to my inner self. The practices and talks by Vin, Ian and Kristine were so incredibly relevant and nourishing, and the safe place was held beautifully for deep and honest sharing… I have remained so thankful in the time following the retreat for the deeply grounded and nourished place I find myself! I enjoyed that any concepts presented were just enough to go about the practices and not too much that we entered too much conceptual thinking. The fact that everything presented was really applicable to how we can approach our lives differently to the benefit of ourselves and others. I really felt the dynamic of Vin, Ian and Kristine worked exceptionally well as there are different styles of teaching but they all complemented each other perfectly. Pre-requisites This course is open to those who have completed Levels 1, 2, 3 or the first two years of the MSc program. Long term practitioners who have completed appropriate equivalent trainings are also welcomed to apply by sending details of their experience to the Mindfulness Association. + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Tags: Holy Isle , mindfulness , retreat , Themed Courses Date Jul 26 2026 - Aug 01 2026 Time 5:00 pm - 11:00 am Cost £385.00 Labels CPD, Retreats, Themed Courses Location To be confirmed Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

Times: The retreat will run from 9.00am-17.30pm each day and finish at 15.00pm on Sunday 24th May 2026 Booking: Please click the Book Here button Location: Online via Zoom Choden will lead an experiential retreat exploring how to apply the teachings and practices of Green Tara to your meditation practice and daily life. Green Tara was widely practiced in Tibet and recently it has captured the imagination of contemporary culture.  She is a swift acting deity who transforms fear and anxiety into a wakeful and proactive energy. She embodies a range of different qualities: a fierce protectress who intercedes at the time of threat and danger, a loving mother who nurtures and embraces us with compassion and source of transformation expressed through her 21 manifestations. The origin of Tara is the princess Wisdom Moon who many aeons ago vowed to attain enlightenment in a female body and rebelled against the patriarchal values of her time when it was believed that only monks could attain enlightenment. She became known as the mother of all the Buddhas and is a symbol of feminine spiritual prowess. During the retreat we will explore the following themes: Bodhicitta . Tara is like a midwife who facilitates the birth of the awakening heart of compassion which lies dormant in each one of us. She frees us from the knot of tight self-centredness and opens our heart to the richness and beauty of life in all its manifestations. Deity Principle . She is a deity practice in the tantric tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. The Tibetan for deity is ‘yidam’, or mind link. She links us to our deeper potential of wisdom and compassion. She acts as an intermediary helping us make the transition from our limited egocentric experience to wide-open compassionate awareness. Mandala . Tara draws us into her mandala – or sacred space of transformation –  and works on our psyche by getting under the skin of our blocks and afflictions transforming them into vitality and wisdom. She initiates an alchemical process of transformation, which is the hallmark of tantra. Ritual and Visualisation . The practice sets up a boundaried ritual space which provides a safe context for deep inner work. We are then invited to use the power of imagination to feel into the vastness of our being and its many qualities with Tara as our guide. Mantra . We will explore how mantras work by creating an energetic resonance within the body and mind. Together with visualisation, they help us tune into our deeper nature as a dynamic field of loving awareness. This has a healing effect on mind and body, and it also opens our eyes to the nondual nature of experience in which we sense directly our inseparable and intimate connection with all life. 4 Enlightened Activities. These are pacifying, enriching, magnetising and wrathful. They describe how the process of transformation occurs once we are drawn into the sacred space of Tara’s mandala. 21 Aspects of Tara . Abiding at the centre of her mandala, Tara is surrounded by her 21 manifestations. Each of them are linked to one of the 4 enlightened activities. They work on different issues and afflictions within the psyche and invoke balancing qualities. For example: White Tara is pacifying and soothes disturbance and agitation bringing forth balance and stability. Yellow Golden Tara is enriching and restores feelings of depletion and burnout bringing forth vitality and an appreciation of abundance. Red Tara is magnetising and counteracts feelings of powerlessness and frustration by engendering inner strength and agency. Green Tara is the central deity and is semi-wrathful. She transforms debilitating fear and anxiety into a courageous, wakeful and ‘can do’ energy. Black Tara is wrathful and protects us when we feel under siege from harmful, destructive forces. She is like a ‘shadow eating’ energy that gets under the skin of negativity and transforms ‘dark energy’ into a source of vitality whilst helping to create strong boundaries externally. The heart of the retreat will be working with the transforming power of the 21 aspects of Tara. Each day we will work on different afflictions and invoke different qualities.  This will involve the recitation of the mantra of Tara, visualising coloured lights transforming our afflictions and awakening wisdom energies. We will then be invited to rest in the space of open awareness. There will be teachings, guided practices, periods of silence and an opportunity for sharing and inquiry. For those who are practicing secular compassion, this will be a helpful backdrop to the practice of compassionate imagery which we do on the Mindfulness Association Compassion module. It offers a deeper context for understanding and applying compassionate imagery. Note : for those people who want to practice the Green Tara Sadhana, as done in centres like Samye Ling, they will need to have Taken Refuge and received the Green Tara empowerment. This retreat serves to provide a context of understanding for people wanting to practice Tara in the traditional way, or it stands in its own right as a modern adaption of the practice. + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Tags: Buddhism , Themed Courses Date May 20 - 24 2026 Time 9:00 am - 3:00 pm Cost £420.00 Labels Retreats Location Online Book Here Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

    "full_description": "Tonglen Weekend Note that for this weekend, it will be assumed that participants will already be familiar with basic mindfulness and meditation, and have an established daily practice, so that this weekend is not suitable for beginners. Tonglen is an ancient Indian Buddhist meditation practice, which is at the heart of the Compassion training offered within the Mindfulness Association.  “Tong” means “sending out” or letting go”, and “len” means “receiving” or “accepting”.  With this practice, we imagine ourselves breathing in the suffering and pain of others, and sending them out all of our joy, happiness and well-being.  While at first this might appear counter-intuitive, this goes to the root of our self-preoccupation, and is a practice that helps us learn to open our hearts to the difficulties in our lives. Tonglen invites us to open up to not only feeling the pain, but also to feeling the joy, of being alive. An important aspect of this practice is that we don’t actually absorb other people’s suffering; we start by connecting with our own innate potential for limitless compassion, which transforms suffering into any positive qualities that we, or other people, need. This weekend will be an opportunity to explore the Tonglen practice in more depth, starting with engaging with difficulties in our own lives, before moving on to doing Tonglen for other people.

    "full_description": "Trauma Informed Mindfulness for Practitioners Trauma can be described as an overwhelming negative experience that has overwhelmed us in circumstances where adequate support or resources were not available to us. It can be seen as a difficult experience from which we have never fully recovered, like a deep wound within the psyche that never completely heals and continues to have a negative impact on our lives. Over the past few decades there has been a growing awareness that trauma can manifest in a variety of different ways, with corrosive effects on our psyche, our bodies, our relationships, and our communities, affecting our mental and physical wellbeing. There is emerging research that mindfulness can benefit those with mental health difficulties, including trauma by engendering a sense of stability and calm.. However, there is also growing evidence that mindfulness and meditation practice can have adverse effects too. In such cases, mindfulness practice can indeed become much more challenging, and without a trauma-sensitive lens, it can actually perpetuate and intensify suffering. The aim of this course is to increase awareness of trauma, by bringing together various perspectives in the understanding of trauma and its effects, and to explore how mindfulness practice can be a nourishing source of support on the journey of healing and self-discovery. The format of the course will be a mixture of mindfulness practice, experiential exercises, and interactive teaching. Natasha is a senior psychotherapist, specialising in trauma, currently working for an NHS trauma service in London. Choden is a long time Buddhist monk and mindfulness teacher. Together they will explore how mindfulness, acceptance, and self-compassion in the context of trauma can promote healing and integration. Please note that this course is aimed at those with existing practice of mindfulness and is therefore not appropriate for complete beginners. Please note that the course is not a therapeutic intervention. Due to the nature of the topic covered in this course, please consider your current wellbeing and whether this is the right time for you to engage with this course. We would strongly encourage you to contact the tutors prior to booking if you are unsure or if you have concerns.

Or maybe you are sharing your life with colleagues, family or friends who are angry, irritated or frustrated? If so, this five-session course led by Heather Regan-Addis on Tuesday evenings may be of benefit to you. On this course we will be exploring the processes by which anger arises within us and is then projected onto others or onto ourselves through a process of blame. This causes suffering for ourselves and for those around us. We will practice ways to manage our own anger using mindfulness and kindness meditation approaches. The aim is to find more skilful ways to express our boundaries and needs in a mature and less reactive way. Exploring our own anger can provide us with insight and understanding of the anger that those around us are experiencing. Seeing the suffering that people are causing by their own anger, both for themselves and for those around them, can be a doorway to compassion. We will explore how to hold boundaries and not take onto ourselves the anger from those around us. In this process we will be navigating the balance between self-compassion with compassion for others. The aim of the course is to provide a toolbox of techniques and practices that you can use to navigate anger, your own and those around you, more skilfully in your life. + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Tags: mindfulness Date Sep 01 - 29 2026 Time 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm Cost £185.00 Labels CPD, Mindfulness Location Online Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

    "full_description": "Compassion in Nature Weekend Do you need to fill up your own cup? If the idea of letting go of roles and responsibilities for a weekend just sounds like heaven, then this compassion retreat is for you. Although we will be touching on compassion for others, our main focus will be self-compassion. We all need to rest and restore sometimes, in order to continue giving. Self-compassion as a practice teaches us how to do this in the deepest and most efficient way. Nature can be an unconditional refuge from the complexities of life. What better way to fill your own cup than to practice compassion in nature! You will leave this weekend with: Several self-compassion practices that you can turn to in the midst of life in order to develop resilience More connection with yourself and what makes you happy An understanding of the need to balance compassion for others with compassion for self, along with the knowhow to be able to begin afresh with this in mind Practices that ground you in the body with mindfulness, combined with practices that use the power of the imagination to connect you with compassion This is an introduction to the practice of compassion for everyone, taught by experienced mindfulness teacher Jacky Seery. The weekend can be taken in isolation as a retreat or as a refresher for those with experience already. It is a perfect way to begin your training in mindfulness with lots of follow-on options available if you want to continue. The Peace of Wild Things by Wendell Berry When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children’s lives might be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief.  I come into the presence  of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.

    "full_description": "Managing Anxiety: In life and in Meditation Do you find yourself becoming anxious about insecurities in your life, about your family, friends or work or about the state of the world? Do you find yourself becoming anxious during your meditation practice, in the face of resistance, insights or fundamental inner transformation? If so, this five session course led by Heather Regan-Addis on Monday evenings may be of benefit to you. On this course we will be exploring the processes through which anxiety arises within us and is elaborated by our habits of thinking and how this causes needless suffering in our lives. We will practice mindfulness meditation techniques to help us become more familiar with the thoughts, emotions and sensations that make up an experience of anxiety. We will be using techniques of compassionate imagery to build qualities such as strength, courage and stability to help us to face our fears and will also explore a range of physiological techniques to sooth anxiety when it arises. We will look at the processes in the mind which lead us to buy in to the anxious stories we tell ourselves, and which make an arising anxious thought into a lived reality. We will also attend to the anxiety that arises in meditation practice in the face of resistance, significant insights, or the potential for transformative change. The aim of the course is to provide a toolbox of techniques and practices that you can use to navigate anxiety more skilfully in your meditation practice and in your life. This course runs weekly from Monday 15th June to Monday 13 July 2026 , from 19.00-21.00pm. + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Date Jun 15 2026 - Jul 13 2026 Time 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm Cost £185.00 Labels CPD, Themed Courses Location Online Book Here Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

Tutor has gentle, all-embracing style which fosters learning and acceptance. The course opened my eyes (and mind!) to ways of integrating movement with sitting practice, and how beneficial that could be, as well as exploring the body/mind connection i enjoyed the opportunity to increase my body awareness through the practice of the body scan particularly as it seemed appropriate for being aware of the deep stabilising muscle of the spine both upper and lower. I have been incapacitated because of pain created by ‘broken’ tendons for 2 years. I thought and still think that Qigong is helpful with this condition. The movement enhances my mindfulness practice It’s great we are able to use Zoom to do all this and meet everyone, plus have the recordings which are invaluable I loved being able to move softly and experience becoming softer each time, and not to just to think that once softness is achieved, there is no where else to go. That’s the beauty of it, listening intently to the body and seeing what it wants to do and how it wants to flow through the many layers of that softness. it feels very freeing. The Mindful Body – Learn to tap into the wisdom of the Body Help release trapped emotions in the body with Mindfulness, Qi Gong, Tai Chi & Gentle Yoga 5 Weekly Evening Sessions 7pm – 9pm starting Thursday 28th May 2026 Complete with course manual and videos to download. “The body is not experienced as a solid object but as the ‘experience of sensing’, floating weightlessly like a cloud in the open, empty, loving sky of awareness” Rupert Spira “The Taoist book Saikdondan says: The rest in rest is not the real rest; there can be rest even in movement. An Ancient worthy says “Meditation in movement is a hundred, a thousand, a million times superior to meditation at rest”. Lopez About the Tutor: Course tutor Jacky Seery undertook her QIgong, Yoga and Tai Chi Mastership training over 10 years ago and taught for several years before undertaking her MSc Mindfulness training. Jacky skilfully interweaves the ancient practices of mind and body bringing together a gentle programme of healing and wellbeing suitable for every body. What to Expect: This course will include gentle, easy to follow mindful movement – using Qi Gong, Yoga, Tai Chi and Meridian Stretches. You will learn short, easy to follow movements and sequences as we go on a journey bringing mindfulness and compassion to every move. We will begin to become more aware of trapped emotions inside the body and begin to help these release with Mindfulness and the ancient arts of gentle Yoga, Qigong and working with the meridians that are familiar in Chinese Medicine. You will learn some mini sequences to do at a desk or in a chair. Cultivate awareness of the body throughout any movement, including how to be more mindful when running, cycling and swimming etc. The sessions will include sitting mindfulness practices as we transition from sitting to movement and back to sitting. We will also practice a compassionate body scan and explore how to move our bodies with kindness. In our Mindfulness Training – awareness of the body helps us to remain present and can reveal a multitude of emotions that we are experiencing or even hiding. This new awareness provides us with the opportunity to give some space and kindness to any pain or tight sensations we are experiencing and allow healing to happen and the movement helps to shift the trapped energy. Benefits Movement and Qigong, both rooted in ancient practices, offer a wide range of physical, mental, and emotional benefits. Here’s an overview: Physical Benefits: Improved Flexibility and Balance: Qigong involves slow, deliberate movements that enhance joint flexibility and improve balance, reducing the risk of falls and injuries. Enhanced Strength and Stamina: The gentle resistance and controlled movements in Qigong build muscle strength and endurance without the intensity of more strenuous exercises. Better Circulation and Cardiovascular Health: Qigong movements stimulate blood flow, supporting cardiovascular health and reducing blood pressure. Boosted Immune System: Regular practice is believed to enhance immune function by reducing stress and increasing energy flow, helping the body resist illnesses. Mental and Emotional Benefits: Stress Reduction: Qigong’s focus on deep, mindful breathing and slow movements helps activate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing stress levels. Improved Focus and Mental Clarity: The meditative aspects of Qigong, including its emphasis on concentration and breath control, enhance cognitive function and mental clarity. Emotional Balance: Regular practice can help regulate emotions, providing a sense of calm and emotional stability, and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Mind-Body Connection: Qigong encourages a deep awareness of the body and its movements, fostering a stronger connection between mind and body, which can improve overall well-being. Energy Flow and Spiritual Benefits: Enhanced Qi (Energy) Flow: Central to Qigong is the concept of “Qi” or life energy. Practitioners believe that Qigong helps balance and enhance the flow of Qi throughout the body, contributing to overall vitality and health. Grounding and Centering: Qigong practices often emphasize connecting with the earth and centering oneself, which can provide a profound sense of grounding and inner peace. Social and Lifestyle Benefits: Accessible and Adaptable: Qigong is low-impact and can be adapted to suit people of all ages and fitness levels, making it an inclusive practice. Social Interaction: Practicing Qigong in groups can foster a sense of community and provide social support, which is beneficial for mental and emotional health. Holistic Health: Integration of Body, Mind, and Spirit: Qigong promotes a holistic approach to health by integrating physical movement, breathing techniques, and meditation, addressing the well-being of the whole person. Preventive Health: Regular Qigong practice can serve as a preventive health measure, helping maintain balance in the body’s systems and potentially reducing the need for medical interventions. The course will take place on Zoom over 5 Thursday evening sessions from 7-9pm. This course is for everyone – no prior experience required – so if you are a beginner or experienced practitioner, this course will hep you begin your mindfulness journey or bring a new element to your practice. The movements are all very gentle and can be done seated if you wish. This course counts as Continued Professional Development (CPD) for Mindfulness teachers wishing to learn more about mindful movement in their practice and teaching. This is a standalone course – where you will be able to take away some practices, with video to follow, to integrate into your daily life. If you wish to continue after the course, once a year there is the opportunity to deepen with two more advanced courses with a focus on qigong with compassion and insight.

Fay introduced us to a way of being with a poem that doesn’t depend on ‘understanding’ it…instead, we each found our own response … and I continue to experience what a rich, supportive, life-changing resource poetry can be. It was a joy to be part of this group, led by Fay in such a respectful and gentle way” “I’m a great reader but had never got into poetry until Fay read a wonderful poem during one of the evening practices. After doing her course I am a convert, now reading poetry, reading about poetry and learning some poems by heart. I am loving my poetry journey, thank you Fay.” “The mystical poetry course has been inspiring, friendly and eye-opening. Fay creates a safe environment in which to explore beautiful poems in a completely new way with like-minded souls. Highly recommended.” “Fay has opened up my whole being to poetry and Mindfulness. The course is inspiring, fun, and very useful to me in my daily life. It has opened me up to the world around me and the beautiful beings that inhabit it. I never let a day go by without inviting a poem in to support me. Thanks Fay for your wonderful facilitation skills. I have loved sharing such a kind caring space.” “I loved Fay reading the poems alive and the connections made to mindfulness and life. It was beautiful.” “There developed a lovely openness between the group.  Touching the depths of Mystical Poetry alongside a deepening into Practice.” “I particularly like talking with such a diverse group of people who are literally all over the world” “I was fascinated by how different my responses to the poems were listening to you read them after our session of mindfulness, compared to my initial reading of them when you emailed them. I particularly loved your ideas about ways to receive a poem” 6 Week Online Course With Fay Adams Live weekly sessions on Zoom on Wednesday evenings 7pm – 8.30pm GMT The online session dates are: Wednesday 27th May 2026 Wednesday 3rd June 2026 Wednesday 17th June 2026 Wednesday 24th June 2026 Wednesday 1st July 2026 Wednesday 8th July 2026 To book please click ‘Book Here’ In this course we’ll be hovering at the crossover between mindfulness practice and spiritual or contemplative practice, and we’ll see what the words of mystics of the past and present can teach us. Poetry has a special power to reach the heart, and mindfulness can clear a space to enable us to receive and digest the wisdom in a poem. What a marvellous combination! Letting the words of the world’s mystics into our practice may offer comfort, open the mind/heart, inspire insight, or touch us where we need to feel. Mystical poetry can reach within us to ignite a flame that connects us to the universal and the divine. Though these poems may sometimes use religious terminology or ideas, we will be taking their teachings as wisdom that we can each relate to in our own way. The course will be exploratory, with everyone relating to the poetry from the context of their own practice, whether they would consider it spiritual or secular. As such we will hold an attitude of ‘no right or wrong’ when it comes to interpreting or understanding a poem. We will also experiment with taking the poems as meditation instructions and there will be guidance on how to do this at home between meetings. We use the word ‘mystical’ in a loose way, to include all poetry that opens us to perspectives that take us beyond the personal and towards a universal wisdom – whether we call this by the name of a deity or whether we refer to it in another way. Each week we will listen to poems and practise being present for a while, allowing the teachings in a poem to ferment and find their truth within us. After this we will have space either for journaling (or writing our own poem) in silence or for mindful sharing in small groups, followed by inquiry and discussion in the larger group. There will be opportunities for those who want to, to volunteer to read a poem (written or chosen by themselves) to the group at the end of the session. Expect poetry from Sufi, Hindu, Buddhist and Christian mystics and from others that don’t identify with a particular tradition. We’ll draw from the likes of Hafiz, Rumi, St. Francis of Assisi, Saigyo, Mary Oliver, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer, Jeff Foster and many more. This course is open to all. We welcome those with mindfulness experience or without, and those who haven’t done a Mindfulness meets Mystical Poetry course before, as well as those who have (for the latter there will be new poems). I am making a home inside myself. A shelter of kindness where everything is forgiven, everything allowed—a quiet patch of sunlight to stretch out without hurry, where all that has been banished and buried is welcomed, spoken, listened to—released. I whisper hallelujah to the friendly sky. Watch now as I burst into blossom. Excerpt from The Most Important Thing – Julia Fehrenbacher A message from Tutor Fay Adams ”I’ve always loved poetry, favourite poets being Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer, Andrea Gibson, Mary Oliver, Rumi, Hafiz and Rilke. But in recent years I’ve developed a new relationship to it, thanks to mindfulness. I just love it when I find a poem that gives me shivers down my spine, wakes up my heart or, in Emily Dickinson’s words, feels like it lifts the top of my head off! This course has been running twice a year for many years now and is attracting people from all over the world! It’s a lot of fun to have your way of relating to poetry opened up by witnessing the diverse responses of others. I’m so happy to witness how the groups become a very precious space of contemplation and connection. Many of the participants stay in touch and continue with long-lasting (online) friendships and ongoing meetings sharing poetry and the poetry of daily life. ” ‘ + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Date May 27 2026 - Jul 08 2026 Time 7:00 pm - 8:30 pm Cost £185.00 Labels Themed Courses Location Online Book Here Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

    "full_description": "Compassion in Action Have you noticed how just beneath your concerns and worries for our society and planet, lies your heartfelt care? If you peek beneath the surface of the concerns, you might find yourself reunited with what you love most about life. Connecting with the love and care we already have can give us a whole new starting point for our compassion in action. From this platform we may find a more joyful, less taxing and more sustainable path of action unique to ourselves. Connect with others on this topic to help find more resilience and an increased sense of agency to bring compassion into action. Become more clear on what resources, nourishes and grounds you. Delve into practices that can help discover new and empowering perspectives. Explore the relationship between any emotions that show up and the love you feel for people/planet, to find a different way of relating to them. Experience our essential interconnectness with all life and sense the earth as an ever-present resource for deeply grounding ourselves. Move towards finding what your realistic and enjoyable contribution can be, rather than feeling that whatever you do is never enough. In this weekend we will build on mindfulness and compassion practices with Joanna Macy’s Work that Reconnects, a skilful method that grew out of her decades long environmental activism and deep understanding of Buddhism. Through a mix of meditations and interactive exercises, we will resource and nourish ourselves with gratitude and connection, so we have more capacity for holding difficult feelings. We’ll explore new perspectives that empower and encourage to see how we can mindfully and practically bring our compassion into action. Whether it’s local or global issues that have you worried, frustrated or overwhelmed, or whether you know you care but just feel a bit numb with it all, this course will offer supportive conditions to ‘turn towards’ rather than away, in the good company of others. The practices will facilitate a growing grounding in ourselves and the presence of the earth, as well as connection with each other and the interconnectness with all life. Pre-requisites For this course it is recommended that you have some mindfulness meditation experience. This could be the Level 1 training with the Mindfulness Association or an 8 week mindfulness course whether it be MBSR, MBLC or any other along those lines or it could be equivalent experience.

Booking: To book this course please click Book Here (Suitable for those who have some mindfulness experience – at least an 8 week course or equivalent) Many of us imagine ourselves on a path leading towards a distant point in the future where we finally ‘arrive’ and everything is sorted.  What changes if you swop this image for a circular mandala? Rather than striving to move away from the present moment and the undesired aspects of our experience, we turn inward toward the centre, towards deeper presence and our innate potential. A mandala can be understood as a symbol of our inherent wholeness. At its centre lies the still point at the heart of a turning wheel — a place of balance from which our human potential can unfold. Surrounding this centre is a compassionate field where all aspects of who and what we are can belong. Of course, much of the time we find ourselves on the stormy outer rim of our inner mandala. Here, many different influences pull us in opposing directions. We may feel consumed by our thoughts, at the mercy of our emotions, and disconnected from our bodies. This turbulence can leave us mentally constricted and distanced from ourselves and others. Over this weekend we will work experientially with mindfulness practice, compassionate imagery, inspiring poetry and reflective journalling to find for ourselves the way into the centre of our mandala. Then from this place of steadiness and spaciousness, we may hold the complexities on the rim with greater kindness and understanding. Here’s what to expect: A reflective, friendly, kind, down to earth atmosphere in the Zoom room Guided mindfulness and compassion practice Periods of friendly silence Carefully chosen poems Exploration of the mandala symbol Imagination based exercises Reflection on the compassionate qualities of stability, wisdom, kindness, and courage Time for journalling and small-group sharing Access to audio practices from the weekend to support you in life going forward + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Date Feb 21 - 22 2026 Time 10:00 am - 5:00 pm Cost £185.00 Labels Online, Themed Courses Location Online Book Here Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

After this weekend you can continue the Level 1 training if you choose – we have both in-person and online options to choose from. Are you struggling to cope with your stress levels or find it hard to switch off at times? Do you think some extra tools to meet this would be helpful? This weekend in the peaceful surroundings of Samye Ling will give an opportunity to unwind in supportive company. We will offer a range of simple mindfulness practices that can be surprisingly effective. Of course, the circumstances that lead to feelings of tension and stress have their own causes and may be beyond our control. But we can learn to work with our attention in a deliberate way to switch out of our internal threat system into a more contented and connected place. We can also focus on dialling up our levels of appreciation and joy in the good things in our lives, and learn to sooth ourselves into a better quality of sleep.

Course Information This course offers a light-hearted yet profound way to contemplate your life as it is, in order to see it with fresh eyes. What better time than the beginning of a new year to reconnect with what matters most to you and be present to the inherent wonder of your life! We’ll take a journey into the heart of our daily moments and each week we’ll contemplate our everyday experiences from a different angle, working with awareness, breath, body and heart, mindful activity, and mindful reflection. In some research on the top five regrets of the dying the following regrets were featured: ‘I wish I had let myself be happier’ and ‘I wish I’d had the courage to be true to myself’. Through this course we intend to address these issues up-front, in each in our own particular life, just as it is. One of the biggest obstacles that we face as mindfulness practitioners is finding the time for formal practice. This course is valuable especially when you are faced with the difficulty of committing time to practice or when feeling resistance to sitting meditation. Mindfulness doesn’t need to be time consuming! Week by week we’ll explore the power of synchronizing our intentions with our life values. We’ll consider the difference between creating the conditions for true wellbeing and being manipulated by fleeting wants. We’ll explore mindfulness at work and at home and look at how environment – whether it be an urban or natural landscape – can become a support for our practice. We’ll find fresh ways into self-compassion in the midst of the ups and downs. We’ll explore our relationship to qualities such as appreciation, sense of humour, trust, spaciousness and confidence and we’ll experiment with mindful relationship and conversations. Recent Testimonials “I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to move their practice off the mat and into every area of their life.” “A huge thank you to Fay for providing the safe and welcoming space and careful and calm guidance. The sessions were a beautiful space in which to explore the wonders of the world around us.” “Fay is an excellent teacher with good communication and lots of pearls of wisdom. She facilitates you on your journey of self-understanding.” + Add to Google Calendar + iCal / Outlook export Date Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 Time 7:00 pm - 8:15 pm Labels Mindfulness Location Online Share this event Helpful Links: - Mindfulness Courses - Courses and Retreats - Train To Teach Mindfulness Upcoming Courses and Retreats January 2026 Jan 13 2026 - Feb 03 2026 Mindfulness Level 1 – Winter Intake Online Jan 14 2026 - Mar 25 2026 The Wonder of the Everyday Online Jan 15 2026 - Apr 09 2026 Train To Teach Level 1 – Online – Winter Intake Online Jan 21 2026 Neurodivergent Mindfulness Online February 2026 Feb 07 - 08 2026 Mindfulness for Stress Online Feb 21 - 22 2026 The Mandala of Compassion Online No event found!

Such a wonderful experience and opportunity for growth. I found the depth of the teachings to be extraordinary and the practices wonderfully rich. It felt like an enormous privilege to have the opportunity to receive these teachings. I found the communal learning experience very helpful and supportive. It moves on from Insight – although it also helps solidify the Insight learnings. My experience is that Heather and Choden always create an atmosphere of inclusivity. They gently invite participation while at the same time their language supports all who are taking part. I felt very included and able to participate. Find a Course No event found! Mindfulness Level 4 – Wisdom This hybrid course (retreats available online and in person) is for people who have completed the Level 3: Seeing Deeply (Insight) training or who have completed the Insight module of the University of Aberdeen Masters in Mindfulness Studies. It involves two annual six-day retreats with ten monthly evening sessions, weekly peer support group meet-ups in groups of five and a daily one hour formal practice commitment. We cultivate wisdom by embarking on an experiential journey.  Intellectual understanding is not enough. This journey requires that we first train in Mindfulness, Compassion and Insight. They provide the necessary conditions for Wisdom to take birth in our heart and mind. Wisdom refers to an innate state of being or awareness that is whole and complete but seldom recognised. This awareness is so simple, immediate and close to us that we mostly fail to see it. Yet when we do recognise it and learn to abide in it, this is the true homecoming of our life. We touch that place in us that is undamaged and pure despite the many ups and downs of our life. This course will explore how we can approach this state of being, both in our meditation practice and in our lives. We will do this by following a two-pronged approach. The first one relates to the profound. We will engage in practices, including imagery-based practices, that allow us  to touch that place within us that is undamaged and pure. The second one relates to the everyday. We will explore how we solidify our sense of self, thereby feeling separate from others, and how this sense of separation shapes our thoughts, speech and action. Living simply and ethically is very important at the level of the everyday.  We will also reflect on the blocks we experience, such as suppression and projection, and through recognising them we will learn how to transform them. We will look at both Buddhist and Neuroscience perspectives on Wisdom and we will explore a path of practice to approach this profound state of being, aptly summed up by the great poet, T.S. Eliot: “We shall not cease from exploration, And the end of all our exploring, Will be to arrive where we started, And know the place for the first time…” (Four Quartets) Try the practice with Choden below, which comes from our Wisdom training.

Sharing that journey with Heather guiding us with her skilful and light touch and sharing also with the other participants of the course I found the introduction of new practices (eg resting in the midst) very helpful. I enjoyed being part of the group, and always felt my contribution was valued. I appreciated having easy access to the recorded practices. The idea of antidotes to emotional afflictions was new to me, and it was beneficial to have practices to apply immediately in every day life. It comes back to ‘how do we want to live?’ ! As a human being it gave me greater understanding or insight into how we all live together , blindly to a large extent, and how small shifts can open up so much of worth to us all. Gaining freedom and space to bring about change in your life and live it to the full as you were born to live, feel and experience life to the full – and wishing that for all other beings. I found it very helpful in my day-to-day living and relationships and spiritual growth. As this course goes on I would recommend the MA approach and different levels. I have given myself a year for each level to allow a flow of practice, reflection, reading and percolating.

Mindfulness Level 3 – Insight Our Seeing Deeply Insight Level 3 course aims to enable participants to develop their mindfulness practice by developing insight into the mental processes that drive our thoughts, emotions and behaviour. This Seeing Deeply course builds on the Level 1 and Mindfulness Level 2 – Responding with Compassion trainings that preceded it. In the insight training we deepen our understanding of psychological mental processes by exploring the roots of our experience, and what drives us. It is ideal for those who have completed the Level 2 mindfulness training and who wish to continue to develop their mindfulness practice. It meets the annual continuing professional development (CPD) requirements of the UK Good Practice Guidelines (GPGs) for mindfulness teachers. Course Structure Exploring The Subliminal During the first weekend we will explore the different levels of mind, and in particular we will look at how to gain access to the subliminal level since this is where the conditioned reflexes that drive our reactions are located. We will see how thought patterns arise involuntarily and how we buy into them before we even realise it, and how there is a sense that ‘this is the way it must be’. Rob Nairn calls this the ‘subliminal reflex’. We will work experientially with the practices of resting, reflection and enquiry and introduce the exercises of back- tracking and HIFAWIF (How I Feel About What I’m Feeling). These practices create the conditions for insight to arise exposing the underling habits of thought, feeling and behavior that drive us. Default Modes After practicing with resting, reflection and enquiry we come to recognize that often we are caught in default modes, which colour our experience. These default modes tend to be underpinned by one or more of the destructive emotions of anger, desire, jealousy, pride or ignorance. We explore approaching the emotions of anger, desire and jealousy with a corresponding attitude of loving kindness, compassion or joy and then look inwardly at the felt sense of the emotion to see what unfolds. By exploring our experience in this way we come to see how our negative emotions can be a source of psychological growth if we relate to them skilfully, rather than compulsively identifying with them. Coming To Rest During this weekend we continue our exploration of the destructive emotions. We approach the emotions of pride and ignorance with a corresponding attitude of equanimity and then look inwardly at the felt sense of the emotion to see what unfolds. Through practicing with our destructive emotions we come to see the ‘reified’ sense of self at the centre of our suffering and learn how to let go of our perception of solid and separate self. We come to recognize the ever changing nature of our experience which is dependent on countless causes and conditions. As we loosen our grasping on ‘me’ and ‘mine’ and develop more of a relaxed attitude towards the ups and downs of our experience we will deepen our experience of resting that we practiced in the mindfulness module. Course Information About The Course “An interesting and clear introduction to insight with plenty of time to practice and experience. All delivered in an engaging way and with humour. Like the linking it with Buddhism (theory).” This training builds on the mindfulness and compassion trainings that preceded it. In the mindfulness training we learned how to settle and stabilise our minds, while in the compassion training we developed the capacity to hold our inner experience with warmth and kindness. Now in the insight training we deepen our understanding of psychological process by exploring the roots of our experience, and what drives us. This training is a secular and experiential training, which is delivered over three weekends or over one weekend and a 5 day retreat. The themes of the three weekends are: How thought becomes thinking Exploring destructive emotions Resting the mind The course aims to enable participants to develop their mindfulness practice by developing psychological insight into the mental processes that drive our thoughts, emotions and behaviour. Cost & Duration The Insight training is taught over three weekends at Samye Ling or evening sessions online and the cost is £555.00 payable in three monthly instalments of £185.00. Location Our Insight level 3 course takes place over evening sessions online or over three weekends at our flagship venue, Samye Ling. The Mindfulness Association Training “Feels like everything has fallen into place. Excellent teaching and supportive environment.” Our mindfulness courses provide an in-depth, personal, experiential practice of mindfulness that are part of a lifelong journey.  We learn how to be present , respond with compassion and see deeply into our thoughts, feelings and behaviours. This three-tiered approach enables you to embody your practice as a way of life. We also provide: Mindfulness teacher training Compassion teacher training Annual mindfulness practice retreats The opportunity to study mindfulness in depth on the MSc Studies in Mindfulness in partnership with The University of Aberdeen. Weekend workshops for Continued Professional Development for Mindfulness teachers. You may be a beginner or have practiced mindfulness with another organisation.  Either way we have courses to offer you. Our training is based on the work of Rob Nairn. Rob is one of the world pioneers in presenting meditation training in a way that is accessible to the Western mind. He was asked to teach meditation by the Dalai Lama. His experience of over forty years of teaching meditation to Westerners has enabled him to develop a unique secular training in mindfulness, and so the Mindfulness Association was created to support this. We are one of the top mindfulness training providers in the UK. We have been delivering 100s of compassion-based mindfulness meditation courses over 10 years across the UK and Europe. All our courses are secular and draw from a broad range of disciplines, including neuroscience, evolutionary psychology and Buddhism. Why practice with us? “Clarity of teaching is excellent and how it follows on from other courses – building on what we have learned and practiced. Plenty of time for practice and discussions and space to take things in.” Compassion is at the heart of all that we do. The Mindfulness Association has 10 years of experience of delivering courses in the UK and Europe. All our tutors are very experienced and knowledgeable compassion-based mindfulness and practitioners. We have a membership providing our practitioners with ongoing support. Our tutors and courses comply with the UK Network for Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training Organisations who oversee the quality of mindfulness-based training in the UK. What's Next Themed Courses You may wish to deepen your practice with our Themed Courses . This entails scheduled weekends and an annual retreat which takes place on Holy Island off the coast of Arran in Scotland. More on Mindfulness The Practice “The tutors really brought life and meaning to the expansive subject of insight.” Mindfulness training isn’t enough! Once we have an established practice and have deepened our mindfulness practice to include compassion, the insight training provides us with the opportunity to build on our foundations and make choices for change. This enriches our lives as part of the unfolding of our potential. This helps us to make choices about how we live in connection with ourselves and our world. Embracing compassion as the second important step of our mindfulness journey we recognise that present-moment compassionate living is the journey of a lifetime. Why Practice Insight? “Useful to understand my mind by untangling the mechanics of habitual patterns.” In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in mindfulness. As modern life has become increasingly complex and stressful, more and more people have come to realise that happiness does not lie in changing the external conditions of their lives but in turning inward and changing how they relate to their minds. In our experience of training people in mindfulness and compassion we have noticed significant changes in people’s lives, but our perception is that these changes do not go to the root of the matter – our Level 3 – Seeing Deeply Insight training is about going to the root of the matter. (from Mindfulness to Insight – Nairn, Regan-Addis, Choden, 2019) “Bringing the theory into practice is excellent.” When not to start a Mindfulness Course If you have recently received or are currently receiving treatment from a psychiatrist, psychotherapist or counsellor for an ongoing mental health problem, we strongly advise that you obtain advice from your mental health professional before proceeding further with mindfulness training at this time. Also, if you have recently or are currently going through a traumatic life event such as a separation from a long-term partner, the death of a close family member or friend or redundancy this may not be the best time for you to start a mindfulness course.",

Course Structure Weekend One Mindful Compassion In the first module, we build self-compassion into the core mindfulness practice of settling, grounding, resting and support. We contextualise this practice within the evolutionary model of compassion, that is grounded in neuroscience and psychology. A key insight here is that we are caught in an ‘evolutionary set up’ that is not of our choosing and not our fault. We link this insight to the Mahayana Buddhist metaphor of the ‘lotus in the mud’: how true compassion grows out of the mud of our lives (the disowned, disliked and difficult parts of ourselves). We then begin to cultivate positive emotions as a way of building up an inner resource from which to approach the difficulties that are part and parcel of being alive. We explore building our inner compassionate resource through compassionate imagery and mindful self-compassion practice. Weekend Two Four Limitless Qualities In the second module, we approach the self -critic: that persistent inner voice that is harsh and condemning, and always finding fault in what we do. First, we experience what it feels like to be on the receiving end of its repeated attacks, and then we look behind the critic to what is driving it; and in this way we begin to develop compassion for this part of ourselves. This raises the question – what would it be like to cultivate an inner voice that is kind and supportive, and to live your life from this place, rather than from a place of destructive self- criticism? This is the point where we move from self-compassion towards compassion for others. Although, self-compassion always remains as the foundation of our practice because this is what makes our practice real and allows us to understand what others go through. In this module we begin an exploration of the four limitless qualities of equanimity, love, compassion and joy. They bring a sense of balance and perspective to our practice of compassion by helping us step outside our narrow preferences, by generating love and friendliness to our inner and outer worlds, by responding appropriately to pain and suffering, while also appreciating the good things in our lives. We will also introduce tonglen, the practice of taking and sending, through which we actively engage with and transform the suffering we encounter in our lives. Weekend Three Compassion In Action It is not enough to learn about compassion or do compassion practices – the crucial thing is how to embody compassion in the way we live, work and relate. In this module, we look at how to work skilfully with the blocks to compassion and we explore how to integrate compassion into all that we do. We also bring the threads together from the previous two modules and provide an opportunity for deepening practice supported by individual practice reviews with the tutors, during which we support each participant in their next steps after the training. Course Information Cost & Duration £555.00 including manuals for all three weekends, payable in three monthly instalments of £185.00 Location We offer online versions our courses. About The Course “The practices given are lifelong tools which everyone should be aware of” This course starts with building self-compassion into basic mindfulness practice. Through compassionate imagery and mindful self-compassion, we cultivate positive emotions as a way of building up an inner resource, from which we can approach the difficulties that are part and parcel of being alive . We then approach the self-critic: that persistent inner voice that is harsh and condemning, and always finding fault in what we do.  What it would be like to cultivate an inner voice that is kind and supportive, and to live life from this place, rather than from a place of destructive self-criticism? In the course of the journey we move from self-compassion towards compassion for others, exploring practices which help us find balance and perspective beyond our narrow preferences, generating love and friendliness to our inner and outer worlds , responding appropriately to pain and suffering while also appreciating the good things in our lives, integrating compassion into all that we do. As there is a strong emphasis on the experiential nature of the course, there are home practice suggestions between the sessions that include regular compassion practice and daily life exercises. This course takes place over three weekends or evening online sessions and is spread out over a six month period. It aims to enable participants to develop their mindfulness practice by training in compassion. The course is themed over the three weekends: Self Compassion Compassion for Others Compassion in Action “I feel this is a journey and not an end point – the learning is so rich and experiential” The Mindfulness Association Training “The content of the course is so practical to the development of compassion. Sharing everyday experiences of compassion with others on the course really helps to see our common humanity.” Our mindfulness courses provide an in-depth, personal, experiential practice of mindfulness that are part of a lifelong journey.  We learn how to be present , respond with compassion and see deeply into our thoughts, feelings and behaviours. This three-tiered approach enables you to embody your practice as a way of life. We also provide: Mindfulness teacher training Compassion teacher training Annual mindfulness practice retreats The opportunity to study mindfulness in depth on the MSc Studies in Mindfulness in partnership with The University of Aberdeen. Weekend workshops for Continued Professional Development for Mindfulness teachers. You may be a beginner or have practiced mindfulness with another organisation.  Either way we have courses to offer you. Our training is based on the work of Rob Nairn. Rob is one of the world pioneers in presenting meditation training in a way that is accessible to the Western mind. He was asked to teach meditation by the Dalai Lama. His experience of over forty years of teaching meditation to Westerners has enabled him to develop a unique secular training in mindfulness, and so the Mindfulness Association was created to support this. We are one of the top mindfulness training providers in the UK. We have been delivering 100s of compassion-based mindfulness meditation courses over 10 years across the UK and Europe. All our courses are secular and draw from a broad range of disciplines, including neuroscience, evolutionary psychology and Buddhism. “I appreciate the gentle kind and skilled facilitators” Why practice with us? “The programme is excellent, well planned and great tutors” Compassion is at the heart of all that we do. The Mindfulness Association has 10 years of experience of delivering courses in the UK and Europe. All our tutors are very experienced and knowledgeable compassion-based mindfulness and practitioners. We have a membership providing our practitioners with ongoing support. Our tutors and courses comply with the UK Network for Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training Organisations who oversee the quality of mindfulness-based training in the UK. “The trainers and materials were excellent – created a safe space to explore essential areas for growth” What's Next Insight : This course provides a strong foundation for Level 3 – Seeing Deeply – where the training shifts to focus on the insight and wisdom that arises from our practice.  As we deepen our mindfulness and compassion practice through a range of guided meditations, we learn to ‘recognise what is happening, while it is happening’.  We find that we gain insights into our thoughts and behaviours and transform as a result. Teacher Training: Following this course you may wish to begin training to teach the 8 week Mindfulness Based Living Course (MBLC) .  By doing so will enable you to bring the benefits of mindfulness to others. More On Mindfulness The Practice “Essential way of deepening mindfulness practice. More joyful and not as serious as I expected.” Practicing mindfulness results in an unfolding of our potential. This helps us to make choices about how we live in connection with ourselves and our world. Whatever it is that brings us to take our first steps on the journey of becoming more mindful, we recognise that present- moment compassionate living is the journey of a lifetime. Why Practice Mindfulness? “This course has made a massive difference to me, how I live and are benefiting others around me too” We are all very busy in our modern lives and some people are looking for ways in which to cope with their anxiety, stress and pain. Furthermore, we are looking for ways in which to enhance our wellbeing and cope better with life’s challenges.  We show you that practicing mindfulness becomes a way of life and enhances our very being. Recent scientific evidence states that meditation & compassion-based mindfulness practices change the brain in a positive way and help to: Lower heart rate and blood pressure Relieve stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia Increase ability to cope with difficult situations You have probably heard the terms Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), or maybe Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) which are courses specifically developed by clinicians to help reduce stress, depression and anxiety. There are many mindfulness courses available for specific problems. “Vital for leading happier lives and contributing to the happiness of others.” Whilst our own tutors and graduates from the MSc Studies in Mindfulness have found even more very positive indicators which support existing evidence, we believe that Mindfulness training is not a treatment for mental health or addiction.  Mindfulness is, however, proven to be beneficial for mental health in the right circumstances.Mindfulness is, however, proven to be beneficial for mental health in the right circumstances and participants on our courses have reported: Feeling less stressed More resilient to life’s challenges Feeling more relaxed Increased self-awareness and confidence Increased sense of wellbeing. “Like going to a gym for the mind heart and spirit” When not to start a Mindfulness Course If you have recently received or are currently receiving treatment from a psychiatrist, psychotherapist or counsellor for an ongoing mental health problem, we strongly advise that you obtain advice from your mental health professional before proceeding further with mindfulness training at this time. Also, if you have recently or are currently going through a traumatic life event such as a separation from a long-term partner, the death of a close family member or friend or redundancy this may not be the best time for you to start a mindfulness course.",

This course it feel very accessible, not demanding and also it helps to create a base of practice to start cultivating this seed of mindfulness. I found the mindfulness association a trustable and experienced source The group itself was beautiful, everyone was open, strong and vulnerable in their own ways and a I felt so comfortable among them. I was bought back down to Earth by an anxiety inducing work problem, the difference was, I wasn’t trying to chase it away or change it, I sat quite happily in the symptoms of anxiety and a creative solution appeared I found so many things beneficial and enjoyable about the course. The instructors were lovely, genuine and helpful, and very present. Yes I would definitely recommend the course its transformational. The teaching , guidance and practices felt very clear, safe and came from a place of kindness and integrity. I felt very included and valued. I have experienced a couple mindfulness courses from other places and in comparison feel this course and the teachers carefully and compassionately guide you through the course content using their personal experience, knowledge and skills gained from their own meditation practices and as such felt completely safe in their hands, leading to a deeper level of understanding both of mindfulness and meditation practices. I think it would be beneficial for anyone who wants to have a more healthy, balanced approach to life. I’m a beginner and the course went at a perfect pace for me. It was also great meeting like-minded people.

Course Structure Foundation Module Start where you are Mindfulness is defined as paying attention to our moment by moment experience in a way that is non-judgmental and kind. We are initiated into this graduated process through the core practices of settling, grounding, resting and mindfulness support. Also, we practice body scan and walking meditation and simple practices for integrating mindfulness into daily life. We simultaneously work on developing kindness as a basis for self- compassion. Module Two Noticing distraction Having had the opportunity to practice settling, grounding, resting and support on a daily basis since Weekend One, we are now in a position to become more familiar with how the mind moves and the unique pathways of habit it follows. We become increasingly familiar with the changing dynamic of mindfulness and distraction and begin to see how distraction reveals an inner world of habitual patterning that ensnares our energies. We also begin to recognize attitudes of preference – like and dislike – and see how they narrow and contract our awareness, imprisoning us. In this context we are referring to our habitual reactions driven by conditioning, not informed choices based on intelligent discernment. Module Three Self acceptance Throughout our training, we are working in two areas – redirecting our attention to the present moment by using a mindfulness support, while at the same time learning to accept the diverse range of our inner experience. Part of mindfulness practice is learning to work with strong emotions that arise and developing the capacity to ‘hold’ difficult experiences within body and mind. Identifying our reactive patterns of preference reveals how working on attitude is all important, and so, through training in acceptance, we learn to acknowledge and come to terms with difficult thoughts and emotions by paying them close attention with a kind and inclusive attitude. This leads to a gradual dis-identification with the contents of our experience and shift in perspective in which we come to see that we are not our thoughts. Module Four Undercurrent & Observer During this module, we bring together all the themes from the previous three modules and help participants set up an ongoing mindfulness practice for going forward in their lives. At this point, we explore the model of ‘undercurrent and observer’ as a way of mapping out the inner landscape of our mind and identifying where change can take place. The ‘undercurrent’ refers to the continuous stream of thoughts, emotions, memories and images that stream through our mind moment by moment, whether we like it or not. The ‘observer’ refers to that part of our mind that sees the undercurrent and has the capacity to reflect on itself. As our practice deepens, we learn to step out of the undercurrent and simply leave it alone. Instead, we focus on working with the attitudes of preference in our observer as this is where genuine change can take place. Course Information About the course “Mindfulness is life changing” Participants will be taught progressive skills in Mindfulness through presentations, guided practice and smaller group sessions. A strong emphasis is placed on experiential learning, there are home assignments between weekends that include regular mindfulness practice, daily life exercises and journal writing. Mindfulness is defined as knowing what is happening, while it is happening, without preference. In the beginning we notice how our attention is like a butterfly flitting from one thought to the next. So we start by slowing down and settling our mind through regulating our breathing and counting. We then introduce practices that ground us allowing our attention to drop out of our heads and into the sensory awareness of the body. We then learn to rest in the present moment getting used to disengaging from our habits of compulsive doing. And then, when we notice our attention drifting away into thinking, we learn to work with the mindfulness support of sound to bring our attention back to the present. The course is themed over the four weekends: Settling the Mind Working with Distraction Self-Acceptance The Undercurrent and Observer Cost You can pay for and attend weekend one before deciding whether to commit to attending the further three weekends. Each weekend retreat costs £185.00 which includes manual and practices Weekends 2-4 of the course can be paid for in six monthly instalments of £92.50 Location We offer online courses.

    "full_description": "Four Year Progressive Pathway We are the only Mindfulness organisation offering a Four Year, Four Level in depth Meditation training, which is experiential, and evidence based and which results in increased resilience and happiness in our busy modern lives. Our pathway starts with training the mind to be more settled in our Level One: Being Present course .  Once the mind begins to settle we focus on cultivating qualities in the mind such as joyfulness, kindness and compassion for self and other during our Mindfulness Level 2 – Responding with Compassion .  Completing these first two stages creates a foundation for our Level Three: Seeing Deeply course , designed to generate insight into the underlying habit patterns of the mind. This naturally transitions into our Level 4 Wisdom training which supports us to recognise the reality of our everyday lived experience. We are then able to live with increased awareness in accordance with, rather than in resistance to, this reality and so we are naturally more joyful and able to cope with life’s difficulties. Our training path is for everyone, wherever you are in your meditation journey. The training is progressive, and you will be supported at every Level by experienced teachers, manuals, guided audio of home practice and the company of like-minded fellow practitioners. It doesn’t end there. We also have our Themed Courses and retreats which will enable you to expand and deepen your practice further for life. Read about each stage of the 4 level pathway by watching the videos below and clicking the links. Please feel free to contact us to learn more about joining this pathway. FIND OUT MORE 1.

START HERE ~  Level 1 ~ Being Present Recent scientific evidence states that meditation & compassion-based mindfulness practices change the brain in a positive way and help to: Lower heart rate and blood pressure Relieve stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia Increase ability to cope with difficult situations Mindfulness Level 2: Responding with Compassion What it would be like to cultivate an inner voice that is kind and supportive, and to live life from this place, rather than from a place of destructive self-criticism? Compassion Level 3: Insight ~ Seeing Deeply In our experience of training people in mindfulness and compassion we have noticed significant changes in people’s lives, but our perception is that these changes do not go to the root of the matter. change to more positive wording: something like : the compassion training gives us the support we need as we deepen our practice; we are able to then move towards insight training which reveals to us what lies beneath our moods, attitudes and behaviours Insight Level 4: Wisdom We cultivate wisdom by embarking on an experiential journey. Intellectual understanding is not enough. This journey requires that we first train in Mindfulness, Compassion and Insight. They provide the necessary conditions for Wisdom to take birth in our heart and mind. Wisdom FAQs What is the \"In-Depth 4-Level Meditation Training\" offered by the Mindfulness Association?
