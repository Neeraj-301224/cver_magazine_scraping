The team adventure challenge that pushes you from dawn to dusk. Ride, hike and kayak to beat the sunset. Run for something bigger. Find charity places in everything from fun runs to ultra runs, back a cause you love, and turn every mile into real impact. Charity runs give you more than a finish line: they give your training purpose. From local 5Ks to iconic sell-out races, you can secure a charity place and join a team that keeps you motivated from sign-up to race day.   Charity places are guaranteed places in events allocated by charities for popular events. Instead of buying a place directly from the organiser, you apply to a charity, commit to a minimum fundraising target, and, in return, you receive a guaranteed place in the event, along with a support package that makes the whole journey easier and more sociable. Here’s the simple flow. Pick a distance and date you can genuinely commit to. A realistic plan beats a dramatic one every time — and it makes fundraising far easier because people can feel you’re going to follow through. The same event can come with very different charity offers. Before you apply, check: If you’re choosing between two charities, pick the one you can explain confidently in one sentence. When your 'why' is clear, asking for donations feels natural, not awkward. Most charities ask a few quick questions about your motivation and how you’ll fundraise. Keep it practical: who you’ll ask first, what you’ll do for a boost, and how you’ll keep momentum. Apply early for big-name events — charity allocations can fill fast. Fundraising is nothing to worry about - you'll see plenty of fundraisers across the website who are well on their way to hitting their target plus you'll get plenty of support from your chosen charity. You don’t need a million ideas, you just need a few that work well: Want quick boosters? Ask your employer about matched giving, run a small quiz night or bake sale, and turn long runs into 'sponsor my miles' updates. Bottom line: choose an event you’ll enjoy training for, pick a charity you truly care about, and start fundraising early. You’ll run stronger, raise more, and cross the line knowing every mile meant something. Want to read more? Read the   from our blog. Got questions?  . Big-name events with charity places.

Often, yes. Many charities welcome own-place runners and will set a lower fundraising target or just ask you to raise as much as you can. Policies vary. Some charities may ask you to cover the shortfall; others may be flexible if you communicate early. Treat the target as a real commitment. Many do — from fundraising packs to training advice, community groups, and sometimes branded kit. Check what’s included before you apply. In the UK, eligible donations can often be boosted through Gift Aid (if donors qualify). Your charity will guide you on the exact setup. Go to   and apply early. Big-name allocations can fill quickly. Check   for East London energy and a brilliant first-half marathon fundraising target. Head to   for a feel-good London half with a strong charity focus. See   for a central London classic with a huge charity presence. Use   for a sightseeing half that’s ideal for fundraising momentum. Often, yes. Many major overseas events work with charities and travel partners who can offer charity entries, packages, or 'run for charity' routes alongside standard race entry. Use these quick links to start your search:  ,  ,  ,  , and  . The basics are similar (apply → commit → fundraise), but overseas races may also include extra logistics like travel packages, accommodation options, bib collection rules, and tighter confirmation deadlines. Always check what’s included. Yes — if you’re taking a charity place, fundraising is the commitment that unlocks the entry. If you already have your own race place, some charities may still welcome you as an 'own place' runner. Earlier than you think — popular races and charity allocations can go quickly, and travel prices rarely get cheaper the longer you leave it. Lean into the story: “I’m travelling to run [Paris/Berlin/Athens/Sydney/Cape Town] for [cause].” Share your training route, countdown milestones, and one clear target at a time. Big, bold goals land better when you break them into smaller wins. Looking for events in a specific place? Explore our guides to charity runs in towns, cities and regions across the UK.

Run for charity alongside the world's most famous loch while supporting top UK charities. Find a cause and join their team today! 10:00 Age 18 & over £80 The Baxters Loch Ness Marathon is one of the world's most breathtaking marathons and is an impressive platform for charity marathon runners to showcase their 26.2 miles to their sponsors and supporters. Runners take on the challenge for many reasons: to achieve their own personal goals, to run one of the UK’s most popular marathons, and to raise money for good causes. Why not make this the year you join them, and make your marathon miles count for good too? For over 20 years, brave runners have been taking on the challenge of running from one end of the famous loch to the other, achieving the golden marathon distance as they go, and raising thousands of pounds for important causes as part of the challenge. Charities buy places in this event, then give them to runners who agree to raise money for the charity – these are called charity places. Charity places are a great way to support a good cause and get a place in the event, especially if general entries are closed. Committing to raising money for charity not only guarantees you a place in the Loch Ness Marathon but gives you motivation to get outside and run, plus many more perks - see the Fundraising section. Marathon running and charity fundraising go hand-in-hand - which charity will you fundraise for? Prefer to enter directly? General entry options are explained on the   page. The charities below have places in the event. To secure your charity place, simply find a charity then book a charity place or join a charity team with your own place.  Save time and secure your place immediately using our simple booking system - look for charities marked 'Quick book'.

The Marathon starts at 10.00 and the race cut-off time is 7 hours at 17.00.

First time 10K run. Loved every minute and can’t wait for next year’s race. Scott S My first Loch Ness marathon and I absolutely loved it. From the expo to the marshalls, the medal to the soup, it was all fantastic. I’ve completed 24 marathons now and this one has got to be up there at the top for me. Even with all of the upward flats! Just beautiful. Katie K The organisation was well done as always. Getting all the runners in their estimated time lineup at start was clear for all. Course was great with amazing volunteers (support staff) around the course cheering us all on. Once again fantastic volunteers (support staff at the finish. Easy to filter through at the end. Everyone as always so helpful and friendly. Already on my race calendar for 2026. Ailsa R First ever marathon! Really well organised event with impressive logistics to get everyone to the start. Great atmosphere and as for the scenery… it speaks for itself. Already booked 2026 as my second and looking forward to everything bar that hill…😬 Gareth W Participated for my first 10K event - from the lead up to the event, to organisation pre and post run, everything was planned meticulously. Support through was exceptional and a hugely successful event for participants and spectators - I will be back! Audrey A From start to finish, I really enjoyed the marathon experience. When things were getting tough after mile 19 🥵 I was encouraged along by one of the cycling volunteers. She rode alongside me for at least 2 miles, keeping me going and telling me I could do it. And I did 😊 I wouldn’t change a thing, everyone was so helpful and pleasant. Francis M This is a great race. Highly recommended. George D Such a wonderfully inclusive event.

You can organise to meet up for training runs, chat with the charity's expert coaches and share tips and stories with each other to keep the motivation levels running high. This is such a super race. I have done it twice and will happily return. The course is interestingly varied... There are lots of marshals, and there was clearly effective emergency support as I noticed a number of runners down being carefully attended to. The race uses a lot of pacers, so you can be fairly precise in what you want to achieve with the help of pacers. The medal is excellent, and there is a big event village, so the atmosphere is super. Ian T What can I say. I’ve run this race 6 times and looking forward to the 7th. The support is brilliant for the whole course and the medal is fab. Kirstie D Ran this event for the first time today. it was a great event, very well organised and the atmosphere was amazing around the course. Didn't struggle with tripping over runners at the start so the pens seemed to be spot on. Ryan B I enjoyed this event, it was well organised and it was very well supported. The race village was well supported with plenty of space for the bag drop. I would certainly recommend this event. Sam B The route was varied with some interesting landmarks and the support was brilliant. The organisation was superb particular given challenges faced by the organisers in the days before the event. And it was lovely to sit on the grass in the sun in the race village with a cup of tea watching people come in. Criddy B It's a very friendly event from the staff to marshalls to fellow runners, a real carnival atmosphere. Rich B If you're looking for a big event with a great atmosphere this is a race for you. Couldn't recommend more. Nat R This was my first half marathon so I didn’t really know what to expect for such a big race. The race village was big, and very well signed. The directions to the start zones were clearly marked and easy to find. There were a few undulations along the way and that can’t be helped but the course was very clearly marked and safe. The support was incredible! I felt like Mo Farah going through Wollaton Park! The marshalls and water/aid stations were brilliant too. All in all a very well organised and well run race. Annie B My final thought for the day were the crowd, notts people did themselves proud.  Very well supported and very friendly.  Kept me going through a very tough race day. Thanks! Phill R Fab support, an interesting course, great stewards, and a certain something that made it big enough and intimate enough at the same time. It's a cracker.

The run takes in the grounds of the estate and has quite an incline up around the back of the house which can be quite grueling but the flying run back down to the finish is great fun indeed.

This event has a strict maximum cut off time of 1 hour 30 minutes (from when the back of the race crosses the start line) for all participants. The 10K is a serious athletics endurance race which requires a large amount of appropriate training and preparation in order to complete it safely. Therefore participants who do not intend to complete the course within this time limit are discouraged from entering. The finish is in front of the grandstand at the racecourse which was really nice. At the end you were presented with your medal plus t-shirt, foil blanket, yoghurt bar, energy drink sachet and a bottle of water. Your bib number included what size of t-shirt you had requested so this should guarantee everyone got the right size. The medal detaches so can be used as a key ring. At the start there was no formal warm up so the atmosphere was a little flat, but pretty good overall. I would happily do this race again.

Take in Big Ben, the London Eye, Regent Street, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square and more. Finish in Whitehall, right by Downing Street!  There is a race cut-off time of 1 hour and 45 minutes for each runner, after which any runners still on the course will be asked to move to the pavements. Piccadilly Piccadilly London Greater London W1J UK Every year thousands of runners take part in this event and fundraise for charity. While this is hugely beneficial to the charities it gives the runner advantages too, from supporting a cause that is close to your heart to securing a place in this highly sought-after event and much more. Committing to raising money for charity gives you motivation to get outside and run, plus all of these extras which will elevate your event experience: Charities know that raising money is all part of the challenge, which is why they provide advice, branded materials and a personalised online fundraising page to help the donations roll in. Think videos for social media, branded imagery and testimonials from previous runners. Whether this is your first run or your fifth, you'll need to train for it! You'll receive an in-depth training plan with guidance, plus many charities have access to expert coaches and elite runners too, who can provide exclusive tips for your race preparation. When you show up on the day, people need to be able to see clearly that you're supporting a charity. Most charities will give you a branded and personalised t-shirt or vest to run in on the big day, and often a training top too. When you're partway through your run and your energy is flagging, what you need is a boost from cheering spectators to keep you moving. Many charities set up a cheer station along the route, keeping an eye out for you to send up a huge cheer as you run past! Refreshments and an indulgent post-race sports massage are often provided by charities for their runners. This is the perfect way to recover alongside other people who have run for that cause. You won't be the only person running for that charity, so it's well worth meeting other runners through the charity's invite-only social media pages! You can organise to meet up for training runs, chat with the charity's expert coaches and share tips and stories with each other to keep the motivation levels running high. The best London run I have done. Sunny day. Great route taking in all of the major sites. As flat as a road race can be. Brilliant atmosphere. Top-notch medal. Phillip S Done this event a couple of times and really enjoy it. Great route around central London on closed roads. Always really good support, great race for everyone, including first timers. Mark C Always really enjoy this event, nice scenic route through London past a few key landmarks. Medal this year was fab, really nice design. Adele V Super fun day, very well organised. Would recommend this to any runner!! Will be back. It was fairly congested. Live music at every km was awesome. Fun to run on familiar streets. Simon A This was my first London 10K event, but it won't be my last. I'll definitely be signing up for next year's. Myself and two friends thoroughly enjoyed it. Good communication from booking right up to the event. Fantastic course, past the London eye and big Ben, nice to see that bit of London without traffic. Amazing support enroute, the DJ and bands made a great atmosphere. Lovely finishers medal, t-shirt and goody bag at the end too. Emily B Well-organised with professional attention to detail at a marathon race level, and the cheering zone at every km is beyond my expectations. It feels surreal to run on closed central London roads with landmarks and unbeatable vibes. Highly recommended, both beginner and elite friendly. Yabing W A 67-year-old: after 9 years of running, the greatest running experience. I'm looking forward to next year. Thank you for your work and the power I felt here. London 10K I love you best greetings from Vienna. Ruthner R First official race but have signed up already for next year I enjoyed it so much. Well organised and whatever your level were made to feel welcome. Sue With over 7,000 people taking to the streets of London to take part in the London 10K, it certainly was a great party race vibe atmosphere event.

Yes — many trail runs are beginner-friendly, especially shorter distances on well-marked paths with gentle terrain. Trail runs involve varied terrain, elevation changes and natural surfaces, making them less predictable but often more scenic than road races. Trail running shoes offer better grip and protection on uneven ground, though there are some easier  , depending on the conditions. Most organised trail runs are timed, though some focus more on participation and experience than finishing position. Yes — some trail runs extend into ultra-distance territory.

    "full_description": "This popular half marathon trail race takes place along the picturesque Middlewood Way and Macclesfield Canal and is now in its 12th year. Great from start to finish which includes the booking itself through to communication, the parking, brief, the actual race and the goodies at the end. Organiser were very supportive throughout. Would highly recommend to those looking for a PB on a virtually flat route on the trails or even those new to running the half distance. Mark T Always friendly and well organised. Good atmosphere. Great to have baggage van right at the finish. Rhona J The pre-race briefing emails were so informative - literally no query was left unanswered! This alone was a huge help and set the tone for race day, which was equally as organised and efficient. Great course, good mix of gorgeous scenery to take your mind off the distance, and fab support from fellow runners and marshals along the way. A really enjoyable morning, and a new firm favourite in my race calendar. (The delicious flapjacks were an added bonus!) Cara B This race has been running for several years now and is fast becoming a staple in the pre-spring marathon calendar. It’s a low cost and extremely well organised event from a small but dedicated local organiser. The route covers the Middlewood Way and Macclesfield Canal between Marple and Whiteley Green (and back again), with spectacular scenery and views up in to Lyme Park. The course is essentially flat, with a slight incline in the first half but, of course, that turns into a slight descent on the homeward leg. As a trail race, the route is very sensitive to the conditions, but the MWW is usually in a good state, but the canal towpath is more prone to mud. Road shoes on a good day, consider trail shoes if the canal is particularly bad! Matt D Absolutely fantastic event. Highly recommend it. Really good value for money. Great organisation - i think they underestimated the number of toilets needed hence the race started late - but registration was a breeze. Marshalls were really friendly and great flapjacks atbthe end for refuelling. The course is very flat. The stretch along the canal is really pretty. This is my secknd race organised by Crazy legs and i will be booking more. Rebecca B This was my first trail half and I loved it. Sam L A fantastic event, with such friendly marshals. A lovely route and well organised throughout. Thank you to all who helped, and special thanks to Beth, Mike and Dave for their support and encouragement. Denise O Fast and flat. Friendly marshals. Well organised start in waves which meant no congestion. Maria S This event was brilliant ! Really well organised and the people helping out were great :) Jassica S A huge and heartfelt thanks to all involved - it was a wonderfully welcoming race and blessed with glorious dry weather (and a bit of sun!).

An ancient pilgrimage route dating back to the 7th century littered with historic churches and scenic countryside. Some sections of which are listed in the Doomsday Book from 1085. It’s an absolute staple on the winter ultra scene. Matt J Anyone entering this event should ideally have completed at least one marathon distance race previously and although it is not enforced, this is a good benchmark. If you can run a marathon in around 6-7 hours you should be able to complete this event. A mandatory kit list is readily available. The route is a mixture of muddy trails, fields and rural tracks and roads with the final section being on raised sea wall. It can be very exposed in places and if wet, can be very muddy. There are some hills but it's mostly rolling countryside and very runnable. The last few miles to the finish can be cold, wet and windy. There are 4 outdoor checkpoints along the way. Each will be stocked with similar food, coke, water, squash, sweet and savory foods including vegan and veggie options. If you have specific dietary needs please be sure to list them when you enter. There will be nuts and nut based products handled at checkpoints. Cut off time 11am - approximately 7.9 miles total (2 hours 30 mins) Cut off time 13:15pm - approximately 15.8 miles total (4 hours 45 mins) Cut off time 4pm - approximately 25.4 miles total (7 hours 30 mins) Cut off time 7pm - approximately 34 miles total (10 hours 30 mins) Finish Cut Off time 9pm - approximately 43 miles total (12.5 hours) The Pleasance 229 High Street Chipping Ongar Ongar Essex CM5 9AB UK Registration is in the Budworth Hall, opposite the start car park. £15pp. You have the option to book a minibus back to the start from the finish. The buses will leave at the following times on a first finished first served basis 3:30pm, 6pm and 8:30pm. Anyone finished after 8:30pm will be transported by race staff back to the start. £6-£10 per day. You can leave your car in the public car park at the start location for a small fee on a Sunday. Excellent, mainly trail, run, thoroughly enjoyed it! Kerry M Excellent organisation and incredible value for money. Super well organised race along a lovely mostly countryside route. You have to be relatively self sufficient for navigation, but with a smart watch that can take a GPX file that’s not really a problem. Highly recommend. Kevin LV Great off-road, muddy race. Well-organised informal ultra, providing great support for all levels. Jon P Great organisation. Lovely trail course. Friendly atmosphere. Marshals were great! Would recommend downloading the GPX route file onto your running device, as will be needed for some sections. You are likely to get muddy! Adam W Well organised, friendly and well-considered ultra trail. Super organisation, brilliant volunteers & awesome atmosphere and comradery within the running packs! Tom S Excellent. First time doing this event and it was everything I hoped it would be. Superb organisation, mud, friendly aid stations, mud, impromptu cuppa at the last stations that got me to the end, more mud and finally the disco lights guiding us home in the dark along the sea wall. Jona D Great race! Really well organised, great volunteers, would highly recommend! Peter B Really friendly, low key, well organised race along a beautiful course that is not to be underestimated - that mud was tough and I think it was relatively dry this year! David A So well organised, all volunteers so friendly/encouraging, great route. First time of doing anything over a marathon distance and absolutely loved it. Will definitely enter next year.

Ideally not. It really is better to hear your fellow runners, listen to your breathing, and take in the atmosphere. But if you feel you just can’t run without them, headphones may be worn as long as you take responsibility for the volume to be low enough for you to hear all marshal instructions and the words of those around you. When approaching junctions or road crossings, you may be instructed to remove them until it is safe to put them back in. The Emmott Arms Town Street Rawdon Leeds West Yorkshire LS19 6PP UK Lovely route, well marked, an enjoyable run. Teresa W Tough but enjoyable inaugural event. Hope to do it again next year in my 74th year. A very friendly and considerate group of runners. Finally, the mud will stay in my memory (and trail shoes) for some time! Andrew M Loved this event. The route was great. The mud was atrocious, which is half of the fun, right?! When you come up across the field and through the gate at the top (near the end) once we went over the brow it wasn't clear where to go. We went the wrong way first, then realised, then saw a pink arrow...but it could have done with another marker up there. Hope that makes sense. Otherwise, BRILLIANT, thanks so much. Samantha M Really great winter race. Loads of mud on some great trails. The only change I would make would be a marshal on the Harrogate road crossing. Luke E Amazing course and support, everything was top-notch. Can’t wait to race again next year! Chris S Reviews thanks to RaceCheck Medals and T-shirts are often a standard provision of race entry, but this can sometimes mean you take home extras you didn't really want (or leave them behind!). To ensure you get exactly what you want, there is now the option to add a medal or t-shirt to your entry order. This means the event can minimise waste and keep down the cost of the standard entry for all. If you fancy doing a good deed, you could also make a 'Trees not Tees' donation. This will pay for a tree to be planted...an ever-growing memento of your race day! Numbers are collected from Race HQ on race day.

With distances ranging from 5K to marathon, all along the flat, even towpath, this event is perfect for runners of all abilities, from novices to Ultra PB chasers! One to warm the depths of your heart. A popular event and a return to the Leeds Liverpool canal, this time just outside Bingley.

Trains leave Skipton and Leeds regularly and Bingley station is about a mile from the start/finish area. Great event. Would recommend. Emma F Awesome 1st time doing Half Marathon. Staff are very welcoming and make you feel relaxed before the run....Plenty of food and drink for after crawling across the line. Chris W Well organised, small, friendly run. Donna K Great race - I did the 10K last time so thought this time I would do the half marathon. The route most is fast and flat when heading back other runners were saying well done. I will defo do this one again. Michael T Always a great event. Chris H Cute little run. Organisers were friendly and helpful, route was simple and easy. Adri Sipos A good challenging run out. Mostly flat...if you exclude the 3 and 5 lock rise, but apart from that, beautiful scenery, a well organised event by friendly and passionate people and good treats to aid with recovery!

Very hard and six hours always in your head as a challenge, but gets me training in January rather than that dry January nonsense : ) Quentin Brocklebank Physically hard and technical with beautiful scenery Faultless, Bustinskin are so organised.

Adam Frame The route follows the Portland section of the South West Coastal Path. The path is marked on fingerpost signs by an Acorn symbol and is a well-trodden track for the majority of the way. Challenging but worthwhile A great day out, on a hard course. Well marshalled and enjoyable. Dan Connolly 8th time that run the marathon so guess I like it. Very hard and six hours always in your head as a challenge, but gets me training in January rather than that dry January nonsense : ) Quentin Brocklebank Physically hard and technical with beautiful scenery Faultless, Bustinskin are so organised.

The aid station was as good as ever and so was the flapjack! :) It is a beautiful course, well organised and a lot of fun! Kaz K Great event and location. Well organised and friendly. Achieved my first ultra marathon. Elaine G Beautiful course, mainly flat and a good running surface. Well organised event, friendly, great aid station and relaxed atmosphere. Hard to fault. Brian T Everybody there was incredibly friendly, supportive and helpful. The course was so beautiful it didn't feel like running laps at all, and the pit stop in between laps had a vast range of different goodies to fuel you. So impressed, thank you!! Suzie F Brilliantly organised, great atmosphere & camaraderie among everyone there. These events are really friendly and inclusive. A really enjoyable and memorable day. James M Of all the events I've done, this one I enjoyed the most. Just enjoying each 5K lap and stuffing my face at the aid station in between and obviously an awesome medal. My most enjoyable 26K so far. Dean W A lovely course through the forest. The aid stations were well stocked and all the marshalls were exceptionally friendly and supportive. This was my 11th Big Bear event and I can't fault them. Thank you, Paul and the team. Robert S A most magical event with such a friendly, welcoming atmosphere it felt more like a big, happy family gathering. The food on offer at the aid station was of high quality and good to see wholesome stuff rather than a load of sugary rubbish! The delicious Tribe protein bars for those of us who are vegans or have allergies were especially welcome as was the fresh fruit... Marshals and officials absolutely brilliant and to put the cherry on the top, a simply gorgeous Highly recommended! Jim E The event was in a beautiful location, well marked, well organised, and undulating so not too hard a route. But what made it was the friendliness of everyone involved, from race director to volunteers to the rest of the participants - everyone said hello, encouraged each other.

The recommendation is to park at the finish then get the event bus to the start. There is a local pay and display car park in Holme (6ft/2m height restriction). £15pp The bus will pick you up from the road beside the car park at 5:50am prompt and there will be a member of staff helping.  The car park at the start is pay and display but is free until 10am, so anyone being dropped off should be fine however, it shuts in the evening and you can't park overnight. Lovely flat (ish) simple no frills race. As a back of the packer I really enjoyed this event. Definitely one for runners though, not walkers. Laura M Lovely event, brilliantly organised. Flat as a pancake and easy running. An ultra for all -- complete your fastest or first ultra. Excellent all-round event. Very similar to previous years, a good transition to new organisers, warm and friendly staff, first class. Boris M Tougher than it looks. Great mid-distance ultra race under the big skys of Norfolk, not that challenging on paper but tough nonetheless. Pretty straight-forward navigation and great organisation and support. Adam W-T Loved it. Great for an \"ultra casual\" like me - nice terrain, easy navigation, good logistics, nice people. Simon B Amazing scenery, excellent crew and volunteers, loads of fun! Everyone at the check points was so nice and helpful. Really enjoyed my day out! I was a little grumpy in the middle as I had not realised how much was on road, but that is the Peddars Way so not much the RD can do about that. I may bring a change of shoes if I do it again... Andrew G Nice ultra - well run. Shane M Reviews thanks to Racecheck Entry fee £60.00 Add the event to your shortlist to make it easy to find again.

From the edge of Vesterbro to the calm of Østerbro, from the pulse of the inner city to the water along the harbourfront, every neighbourhood adds its own rhythm to your run. It’s a course where landmarks meet lactic acid. Where history and heartbeat merge into 42.2 kilometres of pure motion. You pass the Lakes, Amalienborg Palace, the Marble Church. You feel the roar on Dronning Louises Bridge, the echo through the narrow city streets, and that feeling of freedom as you reach colourful Christianshavn, cross Langebro, and hit Islands Brygge — with the city skyline rising ahead of you. 6 hours. Gunnar Nu Hansens Plads Gunnar Nu Hansens Plads 11 København Copenhagen 2100 Denmark My favourite European capital doesn’t disappoint with its marathon. A wonderful route around the city with a pan-flat course and plenty of pacemakers makes it ideal for anyone hunting a PB or Boston qualifier. The looped city-centre route is great for spectators too. The expo is small and a little out of the centre, which is my only criticism. A massive student and teacher discount was a bonus — how many races offer that!\r\nMarc P The course is fast and flat, ideal for a PB, though slower runners are in the minority... Copenhagen also wasn’t cheap and it was very warm on race day.\r\nLisa J Reviews thanks to RaceCheck Add the event to your shortlist to make it easy to find again.

Steve I was attracted to this race through its claim of being one of the flattest Half Marathons in the U.K. It’s a claim well justified and I achieved a PB, beating my previous time by 3 minutes! Luke A great, flat, well organised half marathon.  I really enjoyed the route that looped around the town and then finished along the sea front. Sarah 2019 was the third consecutive year I've run this race. The course is flat and therefore potentially fast. The event always seems well organised, and the slight modifications to the route were an improvement.

With cheering crowds and an unbeatable atmosphere, it’s a race you’ll never forget. The TTP Cambridge Half Marathon route is a stunning 13.1-mile journey through the heart of one of the world’s most historic cities — blending racing with breathtaking views and unbeatable atmosphere. You’ll pass by several iconic landmarks, including: Midsummer Common Victoria Avenue Cambridge Cambridgeshire CB5 UK When the going gets tough, your admirers step in! As 'masters of motivation', your chosen cause will spur you on and provide plenty of perks in the process: Charities know that raising money is all part of the challenge, which is why they provide advice, branded materials and a personalised online fundraising page to help the donations roll in. Think eye-catching videos for social and traditional collection tins too. Whether you're a first-timer or PB chaser, you'll need to train for it! You'll receive an in-depth training plan with guidance, plus many charities have access to expert coaches and elite runners too, who can provide exclusive tips for your race preparation. When you show up on the day, people need to be able to see clearly that you're supporting a charity. Most charities will give you a branded and personalised t-shirt or vest to run in on the big day, and often a training top too. When you're partway through your run and your energy is flagging, what you need is a boost from cheering spectators to keep you moving. Many charities set up a cheer station along the route, keeping an eye out for you to send up a huge cheer as you run past! Refreshments and an indulgent post-race sports massage are often provided by charities for their runners. This is the perfect way to recover alongside other people who have run for that cause. You won't be the only person running for that charity, so it's well worth meeting other runners through the charity's invite-only social media pages! You can organise to meet up for training runs, chat with the charity's expert coaches and share tips and stories with each other to keep the motivation levels running high.

And as your weekend is not just about running, it will be the occasion to discover Paris, the city, its monuments, museums, shows, etc. The Centre des Monuments Nationaux (National Monuments Centre), which oversees more than 100 monuments throughout France, invites you to discover Paris’s monuments. Visit the Arc de Triomphe, the Conciergerie, the Sainte-Chapelle, the Panthéon, and many more. Art and history museums, literary museums, artists’ workshops, and museums of the city of Paris boast exceptional collections in exceptional places: with permanent collections and temporary exhibitions, you will find everything you need to satisfy your cultural yearnings. Don’t forget to visit the catacombs, a veritable underground maze in the heart of Paris. Shows, culinary discoveries, exceptional outings, festive evenings…discover all the cultural good deals, excursions and activities. Decided to run this race as part of my preparation for completing the full Paris marathon in April... Heading back towards Notre Dame and then along towards Bercy, along the rivers edge, was a great experience for anyone running in Paris for the first time. Water stations are plentiful as were the offerings of sugar, bananas and cake to keep you fuelled and the run through the park area, passing the zoo, was well signposted and marshalled. Support, along the way was plentiful with plenty of Paris Adidas runners supporting their local districts. Medal and gift at the end (a travel bag) were of a good quality (and the medal was a lot better than the Paris full), so people wanting “bling” were pleased. Leon B A great introduction to running Paris with this course being virtually half of the full marathon route. Amazing to run past the Bastille and around the River Seine near to Notre Dame. Cannot recommend highly enough if you are planning on running the full as this takes place in March with the big event a month later in April. BG Upon arriving in Paris, we headed directly for the Expo to collect our race bibs and tee shirts. The Expo hall was conveniently situated across the road from a Metro station. Collection was quick and problem free with no queues... We then lined up in strictly controlled pens, appropriate to our finish times. It was a very windy day and we watched as the starting arch blew over! It didn’t delay proceedings significantly. We got talking to other UK runners in the pen and indeed throughout the race. The race itself didn’t pass very many significant Paris landmarks but it was a flat interesting course, nonetheless. Support throughout the race was very vocal and enthusiastic... At the finish line, we were presented with our medals and a nice souvenir sports bag containing drinks and goodies. It was a great event in one of Europe’s great cities and it’s one I’d happily run again. William A Reviews thanks to RaceCheck Add the event to your shortlist to make it easy to find again.

They couldn’t do this without the support of thousands of fundraisers like you. £10 of funds you raise could help support someone calling the MS helpline, or £100 could pay for half an hour of MRI use, so researchers can monitor the success of clinical trials and understand MS in more detail. \r\n \r\nRegistered charity no. 1139257 Making dreams come true to bring joy to seriously ill children.\r\n                     \r\n                     \r\n                                     \r\n                                         \r\n                                 \r\n                                     \r\n                                         \r\n                                 Dreams Come True is a UK charity dedicated to fulfilling the dreams of children with serious or life-limiting conditions, living in the highest areas of deprivation.

While this is hugely beneficial to the charities it gives the runner advantages too, from supporting a cause that is close to your heart to securing a place in this highly sought-after event and much more. Committing to raising money for charity gives you motivation to get outside and run, plus all of these extras which will elevate your event experience: Charities know that raising money is all part of the challenge, which is why they provide advice, branded materials and a personalised online fundraising page to help the donations roll in. Think videos for social media, branded imagery and testimonials from previous runners. Whether this is your first run or your fifth, you'll need to train for it! You'll receive an in-depth training plan with guidance, plus many charities have access to expert coaches and elite runners too, who can provide exclusive tips for your race preparation. Experts include Runningwithus, Full Potential and Olympic champs. When you show up on the day, people need to be able to see clearly that you're supporting a charity. Most charities will give you a branded and personalised t-shirt or vest to run in on the big day, and often a training top too. Overseas runners may find it reassuring to join a ready-made charity team who will help secure your place in the event, advise on travel, accommodation and put you in touch with teammates. You may not be the only person running for that charity, so it's well worth meeting other runners through the charity's invite-only social media pages!

The Great North Run is suitable for wheelchair users. The entry form asks if you are a wheelchair user and if you will be participating in a self-propelled racing wheelchair or a standard wheelchair with assistance (pushed). The route is displayed on the  The route has both uphill and downhill sections. Miles 1-2, 5-8 and 12-13.1 are mainly downhill, whereas many runners report that they find miles 8-12 the toughest section - there’s quite a bit of uphill during this four-mile stretch. But don’t worry - there’s music, entertainment and thousands of supporters at every turn to help keep you going. The full route is the normal half marathon distance of 13.1 miles or 21 km and usually takes runners anywhere between an hour (for the elites) to several hours for those out enjoying themselves and soaking up the great atmosphere. There are six water stations along the course to help you stay hydrated. There are 15 medical stations along the course, with the majority being in the final miles. Achieve your best time with the help of the SOLGAR pacers. Follow a pacer marked with the time you want to achieve and pace your run to perfection. Ideally, run in your shoes for at least a month before your Great Run challenge. Bring old clothes to wear on the start line and throw them away when you start (they will go to charity). Apply Vaseline to areas prone to chafing. If the first few miles are crowded, don't tire yourself out dodging in and out. Follow your chosen pacer, who will prevent you from going off too fast. Don't take big gulps if you're not thirsty - you could put yourself in a condition called hyponatraemia where your body salts become diluted. All participants should be fit, able and willing to complete the event within 4 hours 10 minutes. Any runner who has not reached the 8-mile point by 14:50 will be escorted onto the pavement by the last runner support team. You will still be assisted in your journey to the finish, but you must remain on the pavement. There is also the option to board the welfare bus to the finish, or one of the buggies further into the course, allowing you to complete the remainder of the event within the timescale. The Town Moor Grandstand Road Newcastle Tyne and Wear UK The Great North Run starts on the A167 close to Claremont Road. Runners make their way to the finish at South Shields after a final mile-long seafront stretch. Baggage buses will depart at different times depending on wave. You will receive a baggage label to fill in. Baggage facilities are located at your Runner's Hub. You will need your run number to access the buses to drop your bags off and collect them at the finish. When you receive your run number, you'll also be assigned a wave (striped, orange, green or pink). Your wave colour will determine all kinds of essential information, including your arrival time, arrival route, and assembly time. Due to the size and scale of the event, there are staggered arrival times depending on your wave colour. This is to make sure that there is a steady flow of participants arriving to assemble, and participants aren't waiting too long to cross the start line. Full details and timings will be in your Event Guide. To travel to the event, public transport is recommended as there will be several road closures in place for the weekend. There will be personalised travel plans and updates for your wave start, detailed in your Event Guide. The smartest way to plan your travel is with the Great North Run travel assistant. With tailored routing and event-specific options, you can benefit from the ability to make low-carbon travel simple. The top tip for travelling on event day is to buy a wristband for £6.50. These can be used by runners and spectators to travel all day on event day on Tyne and Wear Metro, any bus service, the Shields Ferry and Northern Trains between Newcastle and Sunderland. Each wave colour has a recommended station to disembark. Striped and Orange are Jesmond Station; Green and Pink are Haymarket Station. The nearest bus stations to the start are Haymarket and Eldon Square. The Shields Ferry will operate from 8am between North Shields and South Shields, and will run until around 6pm.

As 'masters of motivation', your chosen cause will spur you on and provide plenty of perks in the process: Charities know that raising money is all part of the challenge, which is why they provide advice, branded materials and a personalised online fundraising page to help the donations roll in. Think eye-catching videos for social and traditional collection tins too. Whether this is your first run or your fiftieth, you'll need to train for it! You'll receive an in-depth training plan with guidance, plus many charities have access to expert coaches and elite runners too, who can provide exclusive tips for your race preparation. When you show up on the day, people need to be able to see clearly that you're supporting a charity. Most charities will give you a branded and personalised t-shirt or vest to run in on the big day, and often a training top too. When you're partway through your run and your energy is flagging, what you need is a boost from cheering spectators to keep you moving. Many charities set up a cheer station along the route, keeping an eye out for you to send up a huge cheer as you run past! Refreshments and an indulgent post-race sports massage are often provided by charities for their runners. This is the perfect way to recover alongside other people who have run for that cause. You won't be the only person running for that charity, so it's well worth meeting other runners through the charity's invite-only social media pages! You can organise to meet up for training runs, chat with the charity's expert coaches and share tips and stories with each other to keep the motivation levels running high.

A marathon is  . Every event listed here covers that official distance, whether it’s on road, trail or a mixed-terrain course. According to an analysis by RunRepeat, the average male pace for marathons is 6:43 mins/km and the average female pace is 7:26 mins/km but these averages mask variations between ages. The State of Running 2019 report by RunRepeat and the IAAF analysed 107.9 million race results from 70,000+ events between 1986 - 2018 and concluded that runners have never been slower - male runners in particular.  In 1986 the average finish time for a marathon was 3:52:35 but by 2019 it was 4:32:49 - 40 minutes and 14 seconds slower. This is partially explained by the fact that runners are also getting older but gender also plays a role. Both men and women got quite a lot slower between 1986 - 2001 but since then, men have continued to get slower (at a slower rate) whereas women have actually started to get faster - knocking 4 minutes off the average marathon time since 2001. The average marathon pace at the time of the report was 6:43 mins/km for a male and 7:26 mins/km for a female. In terms of age, 30-50 year olds have the best average finishing time at 4:24 hours; under 30's average 4:32 and 50-60 year olds average 4:34 - so younger isn't always better. Over 70's are consistently slower at 5 hours 40 minutes. For more detailed statistics, please refer to the  . Most runners need   of consistent training, depending on current fitness and goals.

The exact marathon distance is 26.2188 miles or 42.195 kilometers. But why? The story starts over 2,000 years ago -  . The exact marathon distance is 26.2188 miles or 42.195 kilometers. But why? The story starts over 2,000 years ago in ancient Greece and takes in three key events before finishing in front of the Royal Family in 1908. According to an ancient Greek myth, in 490 BC the Athenian soldier Pheidippides was sent to Athens with a message to announce the Greek victory at the Battle of Marathon. The story goes that Pheidippides ran the   from the town of Marathon to Athens. Fast forward nearly 2,400 years to the first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens in 1896. A Frenchman called Michel Bréal suggested to the organising committee that the Olympics should hold a running event that recreates Pheidippides' mythical journey. The idea was seized upon - they used the same route and named the event after the town where it all started. The marathon became a regular Olympic fixture - although each event was slightly different in length, they were still all roughly  . The 1908 Olympic Games organisers planned a   route from Windsor Castle to the entrance of the White City Stadium. However, to make it easier for the Royal Family to watch the start and finish, the race was started at Windsor Castle and finished in front of the royal box in the stadium - which added 385 yards to the original 26 mile route and that is why the exact marathon distance is now 26.2188 miles. In May 1921, the IAAF agreed to use the length used at the 1908 Olympics as the standard distance for the marathon and the rest, as they say, is history. The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest marathon and is regarded as one of the world's most prestigious events. It was first run on 19 April 1897 inspired by the marathon at the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. The current world record for men is 2:00:35, set in the 2023 Chicago Marathon by Kelvin Kiptum of Kenya who died in a tragic car crash in 2024. The fastest female marathon runner is Tigist Assefa of Ethiopia who ran Berlin Marathon in 2:11:53 in 2023. Select your location for marathons in your area.

Take on a tough, award-winning trail run in the Surrey Hills and North Downs with a cracking sunrise, stop-in-your-tracks views and five-star reviews! No nonsense trail running. 08:00 Age 15 & over £27 08:00 Age 16 & over £31 There will be hills, mud, rocks, sand, forest and outstanding views. You will need your trail shoes. Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses. Short bio. Trail shoes. Hound House Road Guildford Surrey GU5 9JG UK Follow the parking marshals instructions once in the car park. It was my fourth time completing the series, and I always look forward to next year. The course has amazing views, is challenging, and has brilliant marshals and organisation. Top marks! Isabella K The perfect races. No nonsense, great crowd, courses, locations and well organised. Back home by 10! Anthony A Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses, shame about the hills though 😄 . I will look forward to them in 2026! Emma W Love the G3 races! Always a highlight of the race calendar and always puts a smile on my face. The courses are challenging and will give you a good workout. Well-organised, friendly event with no frills. I recommend it if you’re looking for a fun winter trail race. Mike B This was my 1st G3 run at this venue, and I was expecting the 10km to include more hills, but was very relieved that it didn't. The single very steep one (that I can't forget) was enough. Enjoyed the run along the stream to wash the mud off, even though it was a bit fresh at this time of year. Great route! Great team! Looking forward to doing it all over again. Kyra C Fabulous event. Friendly, well-organised and great route. Fiona A I hate hills and early mornings, so I have no idea why I torture myself with this series. There's just something about slopping through mud, paddling through a river and giving oneself a migraine with the focus required to stay upright on the downhills.😆 If you're REALLY lucky, you will be next to a foreigner at the bottom of a steep incline and learn some norty words in a new language. Don't change a thing. Diane L Fantastic event with a brilliant mix of mud/hills/rocky trail/ splashing around. I had a blast and the whole event was smoothly run, well marshalling and signposted. All finished with delicious brownies and bananas. Can’t get any better to start the weekend, I’ll be back. Katie A What an amazing race, beautiful scenery, really challenged me, but loved it. This was my first event here, definitely returning. Miss V Been doing this series for a few years now, it is a great local event. Course is challenging, Marshall’s are great looking forward to the next one already.

The team adventure challenge that pushes you from dawn to dusk. Ride, hike and kayak to beat the sunset. Chase variety on mixed surfaces—road, trail and paths—across the UK. Filter by date, region or map to lock in a multi-terrain run that fits your goal. Multi-terrain runs mix surfaces—tarmac, compact trail, park paths and the odd muddy section—so you get the best of road and off-road in one event. Use the filters to find a multi-terrain run near you, or browse upcoming races across the UK.   Multi-terrain runs sit in the sweet spot between pure road races and full-on trail adventures. You’ll often start on firm ground, dip onto tracks and paths, then switch back again—great for runners who want variety without committing to technical terrain all day. Because surfaces change, pacing changes too. Expect a more 'run smart' experience: steady effort, adaptable stride, and shoes that can handle a little of everything. Some events keep things friendly and fast with well-made paths, while others lean into rougher tracks for a bigger challenge. Scroll the listings, switch to map view, and use date and region filters to pick an event that matches your goal—first multi-terrain run, a confidence-building stepping stone to trail, or a fun race-day mix-up.

Head off-road and into a world of epic trail running this summer, exploring the mountains, forests and coastlines of the UK. Answers to the most common questions about multi-terrain and mixed-terrain runs. A multi-terrain run is a race that combines more than one surface type—typically road plus off-road paths such as trail, park tracks, towpaths or woodland routes. The mix varies by event, so check the listing details before choosing shoes and pacing. Most runners do best in road-to-trail or light trail shoes with decent grip but not aggressive lugs. If the route is mostly tarmac, road shoes can work. If it’s wet, muddy or includes rough tracks, lean trail. Yes—many mixed-surface races use well-made paths and gentle gradients, making them a brilliant first step beyond road running. Use the filters to find shorter distances and 'beginner-friendly' events where available. Multi-terrain runs mix surfaces (often including road sections), while trail runs are typically off-road for most or all of the route. If you want predominantly off-road events, browse our   page.

Trail races taking in the sights of the fantastic Leeds Liverpool Canal, River Aire and the brutal Calverley Cutting, suitable for all runners, with a cosy warm atmosphere at the pub afterwards. 11:00 Age 18 & over £20 11:00 Age 18 & over £20 Choose betwen a 16km trail race taking in the sights of the fantastic Leeds Liverpool Canal, River Aire and the brutal Calverley Cutting, or the shorter Kirkstall Bridge 10km, which is a fast, flat, out-and-back canal run suitable for all runners. Race registration takes place at the award-winning Kirkstall Bridge, for that cosy, warm atmosphere after what will certainly be a very cold January race! Although the route is relatively simple, the course will be fully marked and marshalled at key areas. The race will start just a hop away from the pub on the Leeds Liverpool Canal. It is also becoming a tradition to do the Kirkstall Calverley Cutter after Parkrun! Due to the ongoing flood relief works along the River Aire we may need to divert the course slightly. This will be decided close to the race date. A mandatory kit list is available. Kirkstall Bridge Inn 12 Bridge Road Leeds West Yorkshire LS5 3BW UK Due to works on the River Aire, The Bridge Pub is currently unable to deal with large amounts of cars so will be limited to staff, pub patrons and medical personnel only. There is on-street parking nearby so please park locally and sensibly. Please avoid Morrisons and Kirkstall retail park (customers only max stay 2hrs). Please lift share when possible. Please cycle to the event as there are plenty of places to lock your bike close to the venue.  The Nearest Train Station is Headingley and is about 800m away. My second appearance at the Kirkstall Calverley Cutter. Adam and his willing team of volunteers are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. The route has a bit of everything that I’m sure appeals to others too. The registration process at The Bridge Inn Kirkstall, works very efficiently. The finish area is in the pub car park, giving you an added incentive to run faster and come back to enjoy the post race hospitality. Would recommend this race to others, 100%. See you next January. Rick H Amazing course and support, everything was top-notch. Can’t wait to race again next year! Jessica B The course was perfectly marked, and the entire event was flawlessly managed. Highly recommended! Rebecca S Well-organised and run. Course was pleasant and straightforward. Nothing more to say other than I would recommend, cheers! Jack M One of the best races I’ve ever done. Incredible energy and great support! Sol B Great low key event starting and finishing in a pub - what's not to like? Nice route with nice people 👌 Matt H Great atmosphere, very well marked route! If you are going to start your adventure with trail running, this is a great choice. 16 km is not just a distance - it is the beginning of the path to perseverance, passion and discovering your limits. Every step to 16 km is a journey into yourself... Tomasz S Really enjoyed this one - flat, fast, friendly. Cups of water ready to drink might help. Rob D It was a great event, well organised and promoted. We started a little later than advertised but it wasn’t a problem. The finish was a bit blocked up and the time keeper struggled to see the finishers as they came through. Also little warning about a local living on a narrow boat who wasn’t best pleased about the traffic and complained to runners. Catherine W The event was well marketed, organised when I arrived with friendly knowledgeable staff to help when needed. Would recommend both the event I took part in and events organised by them. Neil A I don't think the need to improve much, everything is in the information you give. Just one thing if any accident happens is very difficult to get there. Cirilo P Reviews thanks to RaceCheck Medals and T-shirts are often a standard provision of race entry, but this can sometimes mean you take home extras you didn't really want (or leave them behind!). To ensure you get exactly what you want, there is now the option to add a medal or t-shirt to your entry order. This means the event can minimise waste and keep down the cost of the standard entry for all. If you fancy doing a good deed, you could also make a 'Trees not Tees' donation. This will pay for a tree to be planted...an ever-growing memento of your race day! 11:00 Age 18 & over £20 11:00 Age 18 & over £20 Add the event to your shortlist to make it easy to find again.

The aid station was as good as ever and so was the flapjack! :) It is a beautiful course, well organised and a lot of fun! Kaz K Great event and location. Well organised and friendly. Achieved my first ultra marathon. Elaine G Beautiful course, mainly flat and a good running surface. Well organised event, friendly, great aid station and relaxed atmosphere. Hard to fault. Brian T Everybody there was incredibly friendly, supportive and helpful. The course was so beautiful it didn't feel like running laps at all, and the pit stop in between laps had a vast range of different goodies to fuel you. So impressed, thank you!! Suzie F Brilliantly organised, great atmosphere & camaraderie among everyone there. These events are really friendly and inclusive. A really enjoyable and memorable day. James M Of all the events I've done, this one I enjoyed the most. Just enjoying each 5K lap and stuffing my face at the aid station in between and obviously an awesome medal. My most enjoyable 26K so far. Dean W A lovely course through the forest. The aid stations were well stocked and all the marshalls were exceptionally friendly and supportive. This was my 11th Big Bear event and I can't fault them. Thank you, Paul and the team. Robert S A most magical event with such a friendly, welcoming atmosphere it felt more like a big, happy family gathering. The food on offer at the aid station was of high quality and good to see wholesome stuff rather than a load of sugary rubbish! The delicious Tribe protein bars for those of us who are vegans or have allergies were especially welcome as was the fresh fruit... Marshals and officials absolutely brilliant and to put the cherry on the top, a simply gorgeous course... Highly recommended! Jim E The event was in a beautiful location, well marked, well organised, and undulating so not too hard a route. But what made it was the friendliness of everyone involved, from race director to volunteers to the rest of the participants - everyone said hello, encouraged each other.

Ultra marathons are some of the greatest tests of endurance on the planet and yield unforgettable experiences - if you're well prepared. Answers to the most common questions about running an ultra marathon. Any running event longer than the marathon distance of 26.2 miles is classed as an ultra. Formats range from trail ultras and looped courses to long point-to-point challenges. Some ultras welcome first-timers, especially shorter-distance or looped formats. Others require experience due to technical terrain or long cut-off times. Always check the event details before entering. Many ultras take place on trails or mixed terrain, but some are run on roads or cycle paths. Use the filters to choose the surface and route style you prefer. Training time varies with distance and terrain, but most runners spend 12–20 weeks preparing for a shorter ultra and longer for more demanding events. Ultras often require items such as hydration packs, waterproof layers, head torches and nutrition supplies. Check the mandatory kit list for each event. Consider distance, elevation, terrain and cut-off times. If you're new to ultras, look at looped courses or shorter-distance events, or explore our   for beginner-friendly options. Select your location for ultra marathons in your area. A good night's sleep is an essential foundation for a healthy lifestyle, effective training and weight control. Low-intensity training is easier for you, reduces the risk of injury and helps builds an efficient aerobic system.

The team adventure challenge that pushes you from dawn to dusk. Ride, hike and kayak to beat the sunset. A crisp morning start from the farm on a 50/50 road-trail mix with coastal views. Run a loop (a 'yard') every hour, on the hour, until only one runner remains. Miss the bell, and you're out. 09:00 Age 16 & over £73-£75 09:00 Age 16 & over £113-£115 You’ll run together, rest together, and push through together, one yard at a time. Round Two at Dover kicks off on a crisp winter morning. It is your chance to find out what you’re really capable of — not in a blaze of glory, but one quiet hour at a time. This is the first of four rounds in the Kent Backyard Ultra Series: Each round is a new challenge. Whether you’re after farmer’s fields, dry gravel tracks, or forest trails, there's something for you. You can have a small crew with you at the event base to assist between loops (food, kit, encouragement, tough love, etc.). Just keep it low-key — space is limited, and this isn’t Glastonbury. Crew aren’t allowed to pace you or provide outside assistance on the course — only at base between yards. Night running can feel intimidating — especially if you’re arriving solo.

Take on a tough, award-winning trail run in the Surrey Hills and North Downs with a cracking sunrise, stop-in-your-tracks views and five-star reviews! No nonsense trail running. 08:00 Age 15 & over £27 08:00 Age 16 & over £31 There will be hills, mud, rocks, sand, forest and outstanding views. You will need your trail shoes. Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses. Trail shoes. Newlands Corner Drove Road Albury Guildford Surrey GU4 8SE UK Follow the parking marshals instructions once in the car park. It was my fourth time completing the series, and I always look forward to next year. The course has amazing views, is challenging, and has brilliant marshals and organisation. Top marks! Isabella K The perfect races. No nonsense, great crowd, courses, locations and well organised. Back home by 10! Anthony A Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses, shame about the hills though 😄 . I will look forward to them in 2026! Emma W Love the G3 races! Always a highlight of the race calendar and always puts a smile on my face. The courses are challenging and will give you a good workout. Well-organised, friendly event with no frills. I recommend it if you’re looking for a fun winter trail race. Mike B This was my 1st G3 run at this venue, and I was expecting the 10km to include more hills, but was very relieved that it didn't. The single very steep one (that I can't forget) was enough. Enjoyed the run along the stream to wash the mud off, even though it was a bit fresh at this time of year. Great route! Great team! Looking forward to doing it all over again. Kyra C Fabulous event. Friendly, well-organised and great route. Fiona A I hate hills and early mornings, so I have no idea why I torture myself with this series. There's just something about slopping through mud, paddling through a river and giving oneself a migraine with the focus required to stay upright on the downhills.😆 If you're REALLY lucky, you will be next to a foreigner at the bottom of a steep incline and learn some norty words in a new language. Don't change a thing. Diane L Fantastic event with a brilliant mix of mud/hills/rocky trail/ splashing around. I had a blast and the whole event was smoothly run, well marshalling and signposted. All finished with delicious brownies and bananas. Can’t get any better to start the weekend, I’ll be back. Katie A What an amazing race, beautiful scenery, really challenged me, but loved it. This was my first event here, definitely returning. Miss V Been doing this series for a few years now, it is a great local event. Course is challenging, Marshall’s are great looking forward to the next one already.

Enjoyed the route and the staff were very helpful. Nicola D Amazing course and support, everything was top-notch. Can’t wait to race again next year! Chris R Another great organised event, from the communication beforehand all the way through. It’s a simple yet very effective set up. The medal was probably one of the better ones I’ve had in terms of quality and size. Event staff were marvellous throughout. What certainly helps, is having the pub as a hosting place, with a great bacon sandwich at the end. Well done and I look forward to another one! Dave S A great way to enjoy the beautiful Yorkshire coastline paved footpath all the way, a bit of congestion at the turning point, but really enjoyed this race which was also very well organised - definitely recommend. Amanda B Nice flattish two loop HM with a couple of congested areas/ narrow sloped path/ steps to negotiate which did upset progress a bit (not that I’m fast at the best of times 🤣) I’m sure it’s v scenic when it’s not foggy!

Really well organised and truly stunning courses, shame about the hills though 😄 . I will look forward to them in 2026! Emma W Love the G3 races! Always a highlight of the race calendar and always puts a smile on my face. The courses are challenging and will give you a good workout. Well-organised, friendly event with no frills. I recommend it if you’re looking for a fun winter trail race. Mike B This was my 1st G3 run at this venue, and I was expecting the 10km to include more hills, but was very relieved that it didn't. The single very steep one (that I can't forget) was enough. Enjoyed the run along the stream to wash the mud off, even though it was a bit fresh at this time of year. Great route! Great team! Looking forward to doing it all over again. Kyra C Fabulous event. Friendly, well-organised and great route.

The team adventure challenge that pushes you from dawn to dusk. Ride, hike and kayak to beat the sunset. Take on a tough, award-winning 10K trail run in the Surrey Hills and North Downs with a cracking sunrise, stop-in-your-tracks views and five-star reviews! No nonsense trail running. 08:00 Age 15 & over £27 There will be hills, mud, rocks, sand, forest and outstanding views. You will need your trail shoes. Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses. This event is part of  . Trail shoes. There will be hills, a cracking sunrise and ‘stop you in your tracks’ views, mud, rocks, sand and forest - the very best that the Surrey Hills can throw at you! There are tricky descents and some road crossings. There are usually road crossings so always be mindful of cars. Volunteer marshals will be there to make sure you’re checking it’s safe to cross. Horses and cyclists: Always be aware of both. If approaching horses from behind, make yourself known in good time to avoid unwanted surprises! Hound House Road Guildford Surrey GU5 9JG UK Follow the parking marshals instructions once in the car park. It was my fourth time completing the series, and I always look forward to next year. The course has amazing views, is challenging, and has brilliant marshals and organisation. Top marks! Isabella K The perfect races. No nonsense, great crowd, courses, locations and well organised. Back home by 10! Anthony A Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses, shame about the hills though 😄 . I will look forward to them in 2026! Emma W Love the G3 races! Always a highlight of the race calendar and always puts a smile on my face. The courses are challenging and will give you a good workout. Well-organised, friendly event with no frills. I recommend it if you’re looking for a fun winter trail race. Mike B This was my 1st G3 run at this venue, and I was expecting the 10km to include more hills, but was very relieved that it didn't. The single very steep one (that I can't forget) was enough. Enjoyed the run along the stream to wash the mud off, even though it was a bit fresh at this time of year. Great route! Great team! Looking forward to doing it all over again. Kyra C Fabulous event. Friendly, well-organised and great route. Fiona A I hate hills and early mornings, so I have no idea why I torture myself with this series. There's just something about slopping through mud, paddling through a river and giving oneself a migraine with the focus required to stay upright on the downhills.😆 If you're REALLY lucky, you will be next to a foreigner at the bottom of a steep incline and learn some norty words in a new language. Don't change a thing. Diane L Fantastic event with a brilliant mix of mud/hills/rocky trail/ splashing around. I had a blast and the whole event was smoothly run, well marshalling and signposted. All finished with delicious brownies and bananas. Can’t get any better to start the weekend, I’ll be back. Katie A What an amazing race, beautiful scenery, really challenged me, but loved it. This was my first event here, definitely returning. Miss V Been doing this series for a few years now, it is a great local event.

The team adventure challenge that pushes you from dawn to dusk. Ride, hike and kayak to beat the sunset. The Kirkstall Bridge 10K is a fast, flat, out-and-back canal run suitable for all runners, with a cosy, warm atmosphere at the pub afterwards. 11:00 Age 18 & over £20 Choose betwen a 16km trail race taking in the sights of the fantastic Leeds Liverpool Canal, River Aire and the brutal Calverley Cutting, or the shorter Kirkstall Bridge 10km, which is a fast, flat, out-and-back canal run suitable for all runners. Race registration takes place at the award-winning Kirkstall Bridge, for that cosy, warm atmosphere after what will certainly be a very cold January race! Although the route is relatively simple, the course will be fully marked and marshalled at key areas. The race will start just a hop away from the pub on the Leeds Liverpool Canal. It is also becoming a tradition to do the Kirkstall Calverley Cutter after Parkrun! Due to the ongoing flood relief works along the River Aire we may need to divert the course slightly. This will be decided close to the race date. This event is part of  . A mandatory kit list is available. The route is displayed on the  Canal towpath, riverside trails and public footpaths. Take in the sights of the fantastic Leeds Liverpool Canal, River Aire and the brutal Calverley Cutting on a fast, flat, canal run. Kirkstall Bridge Inn 12 Bridge Road Leeds West Yorkshire LS5 3BW UK Due to works on the River Aire, The Bridge Pub is currently unable to deal with large amounts of cars so will be limited to staff, pub patrons and medical personnel only. There is on-street parking nearby so please park locally and sensibly. Please avoid Morrisons and Kirkstall retail park (customers only max stay 2hrs). Please lift share when possible. Please cycle to the event as there are plenty of places to lock your bike close to the venue.  The Nearest Train Station is Headingley and is about 800m away. My second appearance at the Kirkstall Calverley Cutter. Adam and his willing team of volunteers are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. The route has a bit of everything that I’m sure appeals to others too. The registration process at The Bridge Inn Kirkstall, works very efficiently. The finish area is in the pub car park, giving you an added incentive to run faster and come back to enjoy the post race hospitality. Would recommend this race to others, 100%. See you next January. Rick H Amazing course and support, everything was top-notch. Can’t wait to race again next year! Jessica B The course was perfectly marked, and the entire event was flawlessly managed. Highly recommended! Rebecca S Well-organised and run. Course was pleasant and straightforward. Nothing more to say other than I would recommend, cheers! Jack M One of the best races I’ve ever done. Incredible energy and great support! Sol B Great low key event starting and finishing in a pub - what's not to like? Nice route with nice people 👌 Matt H Great atmosphere, very well marked route! If you are going to start your adventure with trail running, this is a great choice. 16 km is not just a distance - it is the beginning of the path to perseverance, passion and discovering your limits. Every step to 16 km is a journey into yourself... Tomasz S Really enjoyed this one - flat, fast, friendly. Cups of water ready to drink might help. Rob D It was a great event, well organised and promoted. We started a little later than advertised but it wasn’t a problem. The finish was a bit blocked up and the time keeper struggled to see the finishers as they came through. Also little warning about a local living on a narrow boat who wasn’t best pleased about the traffic and complained to runners. Catherine W The event was well marketed, organised when I arrived with friendly knowledgeable staff to help when needed. Would recommend both the event I took part in and events organised by them. Neil A I don't think the need to improve much, everything is in the information you give. Just one thing if any accident happens is very difficult to get there. Cirilo P Reviews thanks to RaceCheck Medals and T-shirts are often a standard provision of race entry, but this can sometimes mean you take home extras you didn't really want (or leave them behind!). To ensure you get exactly what you want, there is now the option to add a medal or t-shirt to your entry order. This means the event can minimise waste and keep down the cost of the standard entry for all. If you fancy doing a good deed, you could also make a 'Trees not Tees' donation. This will pay for a tree to be planted...an ever-growing memento of your race day! Numbers are collected from Race HQ on race day.

Take on a tough, award-winning 10K trail run in the Surrey Hills and North Downs with a cracking sunrise, stop-in-your-tracks views and five-star reviews! No nonsense trail running. 08:00 Age 15 & over £27 There will be hills, mud, rocks, sand, forest and outstanding views. You will need your trail shoes. Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses. This event is part of  . Trail shoes. There will be hills, a cracking sunrise and ‘stop you in your tracks’ views, mud, rocks, sand and forest - the very best that the Surrey Hills can throw at you! There are tricky descents and some road crossings. Newlands Corner Drove Road Albury Guildford Surrey GU4 8SE UK Follow the parking marshals instructions once in the car park. It was my fourth time completing the series, and I always look forward to next year. The course has amazing views, is challenging, and has brilliant marshals and organisation. Top marks! Isabella K The perfect races. No nonsense, great crowd, courses, locations and well organised. Back home by 10! Anthony A Love the G3 series. Really well organised and truly stunning courses, shame about the hills though 😄 . I will look forward to them in 2026! Emma W Love the G3 races! Always a highlight of the race calendar and always puts a smile on my face. The courses are challenging and will give you a good workout. Well-organised, friendly event with no frills. I recommend it if you’re looking for a fun winter trail race. Mike B This was my 1st G3 run at this venue, and I was expecting the 10km to include more hills, but was very relieved that it didn't. The single very steep one (that I can't forget) was enough. Enjoyed the run along the stream to wash the mud off, even though it was a bit fresh at this time of year. Great route! Great team! Looking forward to doing it all over again. Kyra C Fabulous event. Friendly, well-organised and great route. Fiona A I hate hills and early mornings, so I have no idea why I torture myself with this series. There's just something about slopping through mud, paddling through a river and giving oneself a migraine with the focus required to stay upright on the downhills.😆 If you're REALLY lucky, you will be next to a foreigner at the bottom of a steep incline and learn some norty words in a new language. Don't change a thing. Diane L Fantastic event with a brilliant mix of mud/hills/rocky trail/ splashing around. I had a blast and the whole event was smoothly run, well marshalling and signposted. All finished with delicious brownies and bananas. Can’t get any better to start the weekend, I’ll be back. Katie A What an amazing race, beautiful scenery, really challenged me, but loved it. This was my first event here, definitely returning. Miss V Been doing this series for a few years now, it is a great local event. Course is challenging, Marshall’s are great looking forward to the next one already.

Nicola D Amazing course and support, everything was top-notch. Can’t wait to race again next year! Chris R Another great organised event, from the communication beforehand all the way through. It’s a simple yet very effective set up. The medal was probably one of the better ones I’ve had in terms of quality and size. Event staff were marvellous throughout. What certainly helps, is having the pub as a hosting place, with a great bacon sandwich at the end. Well done and I look forward to another one! Dave S A great way to enjoy the beautiful Yorkshire coastline paved footpath all the way, a bit of congestion at the turning point, but really enjoyed this race which was also very well organised - definitely recommend. Amanda B Nice flattish two loop HM with a couple of congested areas/ narrow sloped path/ steps to negotiate which did upset progress a bit (not that I’m fast at the best of times 🤣) I’m sure it’s v scenic when it’s not foggy!

Really good organisation and a great location with a lovely finish medal and nice bite upbeat at The ship! Samantha T A great way to end the running year. Super friendly team. Da N Well organised and started on time. Staff really friendly and helpful, no complaints. Thomas K Had a really lovely morning. Enjoyed the route and the staff were very helpful. Nicola D Amazing course and support, everything was top-notch. Can’t wait to race again next year! Chris R Another great organised event, from the communication beforehand all the way through. It’s a simple yet very effective set up. The medal was probably one of the better ones I’ve had in terms of quality and size. Event staff were marvellous throughout. What certainly helps, is having the pub as a hosting place, with a great bacon sandwich at the end. Well done and I look forward to another one! Dave S A great way to enjoy the beautiful Yorkshire coastline paved footpath all the way, a bit of congestion at the turning point, but really enjoyed this race which was also very well organised - definitely recommend. Amanda B Nice flattish two loop HM with a couple of congested areas/ narrow sloped path/ steps to negotiate which did upset progress a bit (not that I’m fast at the best of times 🤣) I’m sure it’s v scenic when it’s not foggy! Dawn D Very friendly team. Beautiful course. Free hot food! Becca J Reviews thanks to RaceCheck This is a cupless event. Please bring your own.
