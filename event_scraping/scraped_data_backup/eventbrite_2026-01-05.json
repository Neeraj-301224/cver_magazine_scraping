Will you join us? This March, people from across the UK will come together to raise money and stride towards cures for all brain tumours. Join us at The Twilight Walk London on Saturday 21 March, every step you take and every pound you raise will move us further, faster towards a brighter future for people affected by a brain tumour. The Twilight Walk London is our biggest fundraising event of the year, as we bring together more than 1,300 members of the brain tumour community to give the boot to brain tumours. You can choose from two beautiful, stewarded routes - either 5km or 10km – that both begin and end at Lindley Hall in Westminster, where you can soak up the festival atmosphere and enjoy food, entertainment and live music. Last year the community raised a whopping £532,349. We know that together, we can push above and beyond that in 2026. By all of us walking and fundraising together, we can make sure everybody diagnosed with this awful disease in the future lives a longer, better life. Will you help us pick up the pace of progress urgently needed by the brain tumour community?",

Walks are led by our expert volunteer leaders. Some are a gental stroll, whilst others are taken at a faster pace. Each walk tends to focus on a small part of the Forest, and sometimes with specific themes ranging from local histry to natural environment. About Epping Forest Big Walk Epping Forest Big Walk is our annual celebration walk where we walk the continuous length of Epping Forest from Manor Park in East London to Bell Common in Epping in one day. Whether you are a first-timer or a returning walker, join people from all walks of life to walk through the wonderful Epping Forest, get to know this rare surviving piece of ancient woodland, and celebrate its irreplaceable biodiversity, culture and heritage. Previously known as ‘The Centenary Walk’, the route was first devised by Fred Mattews from the West Essex Ramblers and Harry Bitten from the Friends of Epping Forest in 1978 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the passing of the Epping Forest Act in 1878. Epping Forest Big Walk returns every September and is one of the biggest annual events celebrating Epping Forest and its heritage. To find out more about the Big Walk, please visit here . This project is made possible thanks to National Lottery funding.",

    "full_description": "Work alongside sector leaders to develop SEND and neuroinclusion strategies. Co-create the policies that will guide FE and Skills Sector When educators and leaders are equipped with the tools, trust, and professional development they need, they can focus on what they do best: teaching, guiding, and inspiring learners to overcome barriers and achieve their potential. This event offers a timely and practical exploration of how trauma-informed, inclusive, and motivational teaching practices can help address the growing pressures across the further education and skills system for all learners, whether they are progressing from school to college, starting an Apprenticeship, or those returning to learning as adults. While support remains uneven across the system, our focus is on building the confidence and capacity of educators and leaders to respond effectively to diverse learner needs within a system-wide culture of inclusion. Drawing on current policy and research evidence, the event will explore how inclusive practice can underpin equitable access, participation, and achievement across the learner journey. Attendees will engage with, for example, practical approaches including reasonable adjustments for Apprentices and employers, adaptive assessment strategies that uncover hidden barriers to learning (particularly in English, maths, and digital inclusion), and approaches to address the intersections between SEND, neuro-inclusion, and socio-economic disadvantage. Breakout sessions will share good practice in delivering effective SEND and inclusive provision within FE and skills, focusing on policies and approaches that create psychologically safe learning environments, strengthen professional resilience, and build partnership with employers and local skills systems, ensuring every learner, at every stage, can achieve.",

Designated Safeguarding Leads are also known as Designated Safeguarding Officer or Lead for Safeguarding there are many equivalents. (This training is not for school DSLs) This is an advanced level course for those that have already had Safeguarding Awareness training including the signs and indicators of abuse. The session will explore and provide clarity on the questions: what is the role of the DSL? What are the responsibilities of the role? Do these differ between different organisations? And if yes, should they? What is the relevant legislation and guidance underpinning this role? Why do people ‘miss’ the signs and fail to take action? How do we overcome these barriers? How can we start to show that we are putting the learning from serious case reviews into practice? Moving on, it will cover key updates (the content of these will be dependent on what the Safeguarding Board identify at the time of the course as key information). It will then move on to ensure that participants are confident in identifying and responding to concerns. We will look at ‘signs of safety’ in the referral context, record keeping, what might happen following a referral, the need to follow up and be persistent. We will also look at escalation procedures. In the afternoon we focus on Multi-agency working including information Sharing and give an overview of Safer Working Practice including recruitment. Exploring both serious case reviews and participants own experience of multi-agency working at all levels. We will dispel common myths around information sharing and share best practice.

Who would you walk over hot coals for this Valentine's?! Take on the ultimate Valentine's challenge with a FIREWALK on 13th February, at Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth. This thrilling event will see you walking barefoot across a bed of embers, testing your courage while raising vital funds for Maggie's and people affected by cancer. Fancy a photo for instagram? Our fabulous photographer will be there to capture your moment. We kindly ask each participant to set up a fundraising page and aim for a minimum fundraising target of £80 to support our work at Maggie's Southampton. No previous experience is needed, as you’ll receive full training from a certified firewalking expert to prepare for this unforgettable experience. Whether you’re looking for a personal challenge or a unique way to support Maggie’s, the Firewalk is an incredible opportunity. Sign up now to face the flames and help make a difference. Together, we can keep supporting those who need us most. Please note the Firewalk can only go ahead if the weather permits. The Firewalk can go ahead with light wind and rain but will need to be cancelled if the weather conditions aren't suitable. In the event that a participant has not fundraised £80 for the Firewalk 48 hours prior to the event, the organisers reserve the right to reallocate their ticket to another participant. Maggie’s are committed to ensuring the success of the fundraising campaign and the responsible use of charity funds when buying event places.",

Step up for WaterAid in a powerful 5km fundraising event like no other. Teams will tackle a route packed with physical, mental, and team-building challenges — all while carrying a symbolic weight of sand. These obstacles are designed to reflect the daily struggles faced by communities in developing countries, where people walk for miles carrying heavy loads just to access clean water. Teams consist of 3-5 participants, and tickets can be bought for the entire team or individually. If you already know your team, please write down other participants' full names when prompted. There will be a maximum of 20 teams on the event day. This is more than a walk — it’s a test of endurance, teamwork, and compassion.
