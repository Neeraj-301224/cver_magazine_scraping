Chords & Courage Join us for Chords & Courage - an evening of live music, community spirit and giving back. We’re coming together to support Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital and the Teenage Cancer Trust, two incredible charities helping children and young people facing cancer and other serious illnesses. This event is especially close to my heart, having personally been supported by both charities through my own cancer journey. I can attest first-hand how much difference these charities make for young people and their families. Chords & Courage is about celebrating that strength, through music, laughter and connection. Expect live performances, raffle prizes, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere, all in aid of two incredible causes that continue to change lives every day.",

    "full_description": "This iconic walk will see the brain tumour community unite to take strides through the Capital, as we reflect, remember and raise money. T he Twilight Walk is back for 2026 ! Will you join us? This March, people from across the UK will come together to raise money and stride towards cures for all brain tumours. Join us at The Twilight Walk London on Saturday 21 March, every step you take and every pound you raise will move us further, faster towards a brighter future for people affected by a brain tumour. The Twilight Walk London is our biggest fundraising event of the year, as we bring together more than 1,300 members of the brain tumour community to give the boot to brain tumours. You can choose from two beautiful, stewarded routes - either 5km or 10km – that both begin and end at Lindley Hall in Westminster, where you can soak up the festival atmosphere and enjoy food, entertainment and live music. Last year the community raised a whopping £532,349. We know that together, we can push above and beyond that in 2026. By all of us walking and fundraising together, we can make sure everybody diagnosed with this awful disease in the future lives a longer, better life. Will you help us pick up the pace of progress urgently needed by the brain tumour community?",

About the walk Join Neal Glucksmann-Smith to walk part of the Epping Forest Big Walk from Chingford to Wanstead. This will be a longer walk with moderate pace where we will walk through ancient wood pasture, Highams Park Lake and reach open landscape of Hollow Ponds and Wanstead Flats. Bring lunch, snack, water. Meet: Outside Queen Elizabeth’s Hunting Lodge, E4 7QH. This is a short walk from Chingford station (Weaver Line). What3words : duck.bills.atoms Endpoint: The walk will finish at Manor Park, the southern end of Epping Forest. It’s at the junction of Forest Drive and Capel Road, near Manor Park Station. Google Map location here . About EFHT and our Guided Walks in Epping Forest Join our Guided Walks to discover more of Epping Forest and its ecology, heritage and cultural. Walks are led by our expert volunteer leaders. Some are a gental stroll, whilst others are taken at a faster pace. Each walk tends to focus on a small part of the Forest, and sometimes with specific themes ranging from local histry to natural environment. About Epping Forest Big Walk Epping Forest Big Walk is our annual celebration walk where we walk the continuous length of Epping Forest from Manor Park in East London to Bell Common in Epping in one day. Whether you are a first-timer or a returning walker, join people from all walks of life to walk through the wonderful Epping Forest, get to know this rare surviving piece of ancient woodland, and celebrate its irreplaceable biodiversity, culture and heritage. Previously known as ‘The Centenary Walk’, the route was first devised by Fred Mattews from the West Essex Ramblers and Harry Bitten from the Friends of Epping Forest in 1978 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the passing of the Epping Forest Act in 1878. Epping Forest Big Walk returns every September and is one of the biggest annual events celebrating Epping Forest and its heritage. To find out more about the Big Walk, please visit here . This project is made possible thanks to National Lottery funding.",

    "full_description": "Join us at the Library for the launch of the RIBA Refugee Committee online database. From 1938 the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) received a fast-growing number of requests for assistance from architects working in Nazi-occupied Central Europe. The Papers of the RIBA Refugee Committee, specially set up by the institute in January 1939, include documents and correspondence related to more than 200 individuals (mostly architects) who became known to the RIBA between 1938 and 1941. A result of groundbreaking research on the RIBA Refugee Committee Papers, the database will include entries for each one of these individuals, whatever their fate or their stature. Their lives, their work, their often extraordinary stories will be shared and celebrated through this new international research hub. About the speakers Oliver Urquhart Irvine is Executive Director of Architecture Programmes and Collections at the Royal Institute of British Architects. He leads RIBA’s exhibitions and public programmes, awards and honours, library and collections, partnerships and fundraising, and is overseeing the long-term transformation of access to RIBA’s collections. Oliver has over 25 years’ experience working across cultural, heritage and higher education organisations, with a particular focus on libraries, archives, collections, education and digital access. Before joining RIBA, he was Director of the SOAS National Research Library and Director of Learning, Research and Enterprise Services at SOAS University of London, where he was also a Trustee and Principal Investigator on major externally funded research and digitisation programmes. Valeria Carullo is Curator of the Robert Elwall Photographs Collection at the Royal Institute of British Architects. Her principal area of research is the relationship between modern photography and modern architecture in the inter-war years. An architect by background, she lectures and writes on both architectural and photographic subjects. In 2019 she published Moholy-Nagy in Britain 1935-1937 (Lund Humphries). Valeria has curated and co-curated several exhibitions, including her latest Wide Angle View: architecture as social space in the Manplan series 1969-70 (RIBA London, 2023-24, and RIBA Liverpool, 2026). She is the lead researcher of the ongoing RIBA Refugee Committee project and in June 2024 she organised the international conference Displaced Lives: Architects Seeking Refuge on the Brink of WWII. Dr Irena Žantovská Murray HonFRIBA is an architectural historian and curator. In her work, she has focused primarily on exploring aspects of 20th century architecture, with emphasis on the Modern Movement. Professionally, she devoted most of her career to building, advancing and making accessible art and architectural collections, first at McGill University in Montreal and, from 2004 to 2013, as Sir Banister Fletcher Director, British Architectural Library, at the Royal Institute of British Architects. She is currently a Research Fellow at the Faculty of Architecture, Czech Technical University, in Prague. As an editor, co-editor or translator, she has been responsible for publications such as Moshe Safdie: Buildings and Projects (1996), Karel Teige, Modern Architecture in Czechoslovakia (2000), Le Corbusier and Britain (2009) and Guido Beltramini, The Private Palladio (2012). She is the principal external contributor to the RIBA Refugee Committee research project.",

Across the globe, migration and displacement continue to shape societies and challenge political, ethical, and social frameworks.

This symposium seeks to provide a space for thoughtful, rigorous, and constructive dialogue on how faith leaders and communities engage with issues of migration, asylum, integration, and diversity. Welcoming presentations across academic disciplines and practitioner perspectives, the symposium will explore how faith informs responses to the movement of people, and discuss how best to foster collaboration and deepen understanding of the ethical and social dimensions of migration in the modern world.

    "full_description": "Join the Guilty Feminist community for an energising event exploring grassroots action to resist the rise of the far right. Utilising Open Space methodology, this  event will enable like-minded collaborators to explore and create grassroots actions to resist the rise of the far right, Christian nationalists and ethno-nationalism. We may well be on the Road to Gilead, but together, we can turn things around! This is your invitation to rise, collaborate, and reimagine what’s possible. Header image credit: Linda Cooper What can I expect? This event welcomes everyone resisting “The Road to Gilead”. Gilead is shorthand for an oppressive far-right future as envisioned by far-right “Christian” nationalists who wish to take our reproductive rights, restrict LGBTQ+ rights and create an ethnonationalist state. We wish to welcome people of no faith, all faiths and faith-based communities. We want to create a coalition of like-minded citizens who want a more equitable, compassionate, connected society. Let’s get inspired and organised and build the world we do want to live in. This is your invitation to rise, collaborate, and reimagine what’s possible! The Open Space method allows individuals to bring ideas, projects, problems and challenges and break into small groups to tackle them. You can come with ideas or just a willingness to engage, discuss and problem solve. Our hope is to see several grassroots projects find legs through this day, as well as encouraging connections for future endeavours. Discussion is wonderful and action is necessary. What are the options for taking part? Attend in person: £10 (+Eventbrite fee) This is for folks who wish to join us in person for the full day of activities. Lunch and hot drinks will be provided. If cost is a barrier to attend this event, we have free tickets available. Please email activistevents@amnesty.org.uk to request one. Join us online: free Choose this option if you’re unable to join us in person on the day but would like to take part remotely. You'll be able to attend the two plenary sessions (currently scheduled for 11am and 3:45pm). We also encourage you to gather your own group of interested people (in your town, or any community you are part of) and feedback your ideas/hear the in-person groups' contributions at the end of the day. We are planning online break-out rooms for discussions - more details to follow. The link for joining us online will be shared with you in advance of the event.",

    "full_description": "An evening of exquisite food, fine whisky, friendship and fun Our annual Burns Celebration is one of our favourite – and most popular – events of the year. It brings together our diverse College community for an evening of exquisite food, fine whisky, friendship and fun. Our Burns Celebration takes place just before Burns Night in celebration of Scotland’s most famous poet, Robert Burns. He wrote more than 550 poems and songs before his death in 1796 and is recognised today as ‘Scotland’s national poet’. This special event will celebrate his life and work through poetry and music. To raise extra funds to support health projects in Malawi, there will be a raffle with exciting prizes on offer. The Burns Celebration will take place in the majestic College Hall, an atmospheric wood-panelled room dating from 1893. Designed by the renowned Scottish architect Sir J J Burnet (1857–1938), it is one of the finest examples of Victorian architecture anywhere in the city. We cater for a wide variety of dietary requirements. More information will be available during the booking process. Each ticket includes: Drink on arrival Three-course dinner Half a bottle of wine with your meal Entertainment (piper, poetry and music) Venue: Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow Dress code: Highland dress or lounge suits Start: 7pm; Finish: Midnight Tickets: £70 per person Special early bird offer: £10 off tickets until the end of November.

Walk for Water: The Ultimate Team Challenge Step up for WaterAid in a powerful 5km fundraising event like no other. Teams will tackle a route packed with physical, mental, and team-building challenges — all while carrying a symbolic weight of sand. These obstacles are designed to reflect the daily struggles faced by communities in developing countries, where people walk for miles carrying heavy loads just to access clean water. Teams consist of 3-5 participants, and tickets can be bought for the entire team or individually. If you already know your team, please write down other participants' full names when prompted. There will be a maximum of 20 teams on the event day. This is more than a walk — it’s a test of endurance, teamwork, and compassion. Are you up for the challenge?",
