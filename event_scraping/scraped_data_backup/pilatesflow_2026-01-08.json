Our FREE Introduction to Pilates Workshop is a friendly, no-commitment session designed to introduce you to the basics in a relaxed and welcoming space. Date & Time: 4th of January 10:30 am – 11:45 am Location:  (Severn Vale School) Why Join? This workshop is perfect for you if you’ve ever thought: – ‘I’m not flexible enough for Pilates!’ —Pilates is for all flexibility levels, and we start at a pace that’s just right for you. – ‘I have back pain/old injuries; is it safe?’ — I’m not a physiotherapist so if you are not cleared to exercise you will not be able to participate. However, the most common orthopaedic conditions and injuries are covered by Pilates. I’ll cover modifications /adaptations and layers and show you how Pilates can support your body’s unique needs. – ‘I’m totally new to this; will I be lost?’ —This session is designed for beginners, and we’ll go step-by-step introducing you to the fundamental principles, which even if you choose not to continue, will improve your technique at the gym or anywhere else. – ‘I’m too busy to commit to regular classes.’ —This intro session is just 60 minutes, no strings attached—just come as you are and enjoy! Besides… We don’t do subscriptions or block booking either. What do you need? – Your unique body, wearing socks. – Enthusiasm is always good to bring! – Yoga or Pilates mat is needed. If you don’t have one, please contact us at office@pilatesflow.uk to reserve a mat. We only have a few spares! ===================================== In this workshop, you’ll get a feel for Pilates fundamentals, learn about its many benefits, and try gentle exercises to start improving posture, core strength, and body awareness. Bring yourself and any questions you may have! Reserve your spot today and take the first step toward feeling stronger, more balanced, and more energised.",
